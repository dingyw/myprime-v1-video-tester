    What can we say about social dependence in the Red Phase?
    Frosty: </b> <br/>
    Interesting question, because while many of the things that we describe in the Orange Phase do intensify and carry forward into the Red Phase, something else might happen with social dependence. Now one, it might continue, and I might continue to surrund myself with people who drink like I do, and I might feel support from that system. On the other hand, in the Red Phase, I might actually begin to isolate myself from others, and others may begin to drop out of my life. And furthermore, I don't need a social support group to continue making my high-risk choices, because addiction is in control of my life. So in reality, addiction may disappear in the Red Phase. </p>

    Early in the Red Phase social dependence can look like the Orange Phase, but later in the phase, as their relationship with alcohol or drugs intensifies, people often experience that their relationships become limited to others who are also in the Red Phase, or to suppliers or the substance itself... </p>

    They may not enjoy being around people who do not drink or use like they do. Drinking buddies may become our best friends, but the relationship is centered around use.
    Take away the drinking or drugs and there may be no basis for friendship. </p>

    We may get divorced or lose friendships with those who do not drink or use drugs like we do. </p>
