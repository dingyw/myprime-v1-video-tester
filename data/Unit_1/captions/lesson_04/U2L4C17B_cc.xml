	   In the Red Phase, blackouts are likely to happen more frequently, and they may also last longer than they have in the past. On top of that, the nature of the blackouts may change in a way thatâ€™s unique to people in the Red Phase. 
During a typical blackout in the Orange Phase, the person shows clear signs of physical impairment, and will appear to be intoxicated.
