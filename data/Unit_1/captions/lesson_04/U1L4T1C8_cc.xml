      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:02.50">ANTONIO: So, Doctor, it's pretty straightforward.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:02.00" dur="00:00:07.00">DR. COLLIVER: Yes it is. The key thing you want to remember is anyone can develop heart disease. And our biology sets the trigger level.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Just to review—if I have a lower trigger level that means I can develop heart disease more easily...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:06.00">DR. COLLIVER: Yes. And the flip side—if I have a higher trigger level, then I have decreased risk of heart disease.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: But everyone has some level of risk?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:02.00">DR. COLLIVER: You got it.</p>
