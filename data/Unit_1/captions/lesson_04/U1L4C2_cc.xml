	   We’ve been talking about lifestyle-related health problems. 
And the first one we’re going to focus on is heart disease; something most people think could happen to them. 
Okay.  Now, I know it might seem a little strange to talk about heart disease in a drug and alcohol program.  But you’ll see how it ties in shortly.
So, there’s a good chance you know someone living with heart disease, or someone who’s died from a heart attack.  A friend, a colleague, maybe even a family member.  Heart disease is—unfortunately—very common. 
And that’s why we’re looking at heart disease first; most of us are familiar with it.   We’ll use heart disease to learn some important principles that we can then apply to all lifestyle-related health problems. 
And those principles can help us prevent future problems with drugs and alcohol.
