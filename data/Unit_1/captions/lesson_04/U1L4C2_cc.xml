      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: And the first one we're going to focus on is heart disease; something most people think could happen to them. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Okay. Now, I know it might seem a little strange to talk about heart disease in a drug and alcohol program. But you'll see how it ties in shortly.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: So, there's a good chance you know someone living with heart disease, or someone who's died from a heart attack. A friend, a colleague, maybe even a family member. Heart disease is—unfortunately—very common. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: And that's why we're looking at heart disease first; most of us are familiar with it.  We'll use heart disease to learn some important principles that we can then apply to all lifestyle-related health problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: And those principles can help us prevent future problems with drugs and alcohol.</p>
