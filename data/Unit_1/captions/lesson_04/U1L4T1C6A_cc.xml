	   Meet Prime Pat.  Pat’s a….  cartoon character.  
And Pat’s going to show us how the formula for lifestyle-related health problems works. 
Each of us is born with a different amount of biological risk for heart disease.  This risk level is like a threshold.  And when a person crosses it, heart disease is triggered. 
We call this threshold the “trigger level.” It’s the point at which heart disease begins.
Anyone can develop heart disease, but the trigger level varies from person to person. 
This line represents a standard trigger level. 
People who have increased biological risk have a lower trigger level.  For example, Pat’s friend… Chris.
If we think of risk building from the bottom up, Chris reaches the trigger level sooner, which means heart disease can be triggered more quickly and easily.
When heart disease runs in families, members of that family inherit lower trigger levels than others do.
Some people have strongly increased biological risk, like Alex here.
This means they have even lower trigger levels, and it will be even easier for them to develop heart disease.  
We all have a different trigger level, but everyone has some level of risk.  
And knowing about our own biological risks can help us to make informed choices.
