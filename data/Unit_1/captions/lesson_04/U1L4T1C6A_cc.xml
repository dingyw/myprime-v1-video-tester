      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">NARRATOR: Meet Prime Pat. Pat's a... cartoon character. And Pat's going to show us how the formula for lifestyle-related health problems works. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: Each of us is born with a different amount of biological risk for heart disease. This risk level is like a threshold. And when a person crosses it, heart disease is triggered.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: We call this threshold the "trigger level." It's the point at which heart disease begins. Anyone can develop heart disease, but the trigger level varies from person to person. This line represents a standard trigger level. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: Some people have strongly increased biological risk, like Alex here.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: This means they have even lower trigger levels, and it will be even easier for them to develop heart disease. We all have a different trigger level, but everyone has some level of risk. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: And knowing about our own biological risks can help us to make informed choices.</p>
