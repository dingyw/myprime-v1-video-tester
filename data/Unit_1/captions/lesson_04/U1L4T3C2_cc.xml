      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">ANTONIO: We make lots of choices every day like... What to wear, how to spend our money or what to eat...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: And we don't make these choices in a vacuum; they're influenced by the things going on in our lives... such as wanting to stay healthy.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Every decision we make is influenced by psychological influences like our attitudes, beliefs, values, preferences and our personalities.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: When it comes to heart disease, these might be attitudes like... "Exercising is a total waste of time." Or...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: "I'm not big on vegetables. They just don't fill me up."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Social factors also play a role. Friends, family, media and social norms all influence our choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: There was a time when eating healthy food and exercising before breakfast made you a weird "health nut."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: That attitude didn't exactly encourage people to take care of themselves.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Today things are different. People want to be seen as physically fit.  And that's because social norms have changed. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: So psychological and social factors can influence our choices, but they don't cause or prevent the health problem. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Any of us can reduce our own risk, and make low-risk choices regardless of our personality or social group. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Now, it's time to test your understanding of the concepts we've just learned. Watch this video clip; there will be a few questions about it afterwards.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: Meet Joe. Joe means well, but he doesn't always eat healthy food.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.00" dur="00:00:17.00">NARRATOR: Greasy takeout last night, pizza today— Joe's usually up late, surfing the web with the help of a case of cola and a bag—or two—of chips.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: In fact, just about the only time Joe and his friends get their heart rate up is during an especially competitive video game.</p>
