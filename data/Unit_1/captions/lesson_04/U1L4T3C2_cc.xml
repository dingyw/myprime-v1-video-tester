	   We make lots of choices every day like...  What to wear, how to spend our money or what to eat …
And we don’t make these choices in a vacuum; they’re influenced by the things going on in our lives… such as wanting to stay healthy. 
		Every decision we make is influenced by psychological influences like our attitudes, beliefs, values, preferences and our personalities.   
		
When it comes to heart disease, these might be attitudes like…
 “Exercising is a total waste of time.”
Or….
“I’m not big on vegetables.  They just don’t fill me up.”
Social factors also play a role.  Friends, family, media and social norms all influence our choices. 
There was a time when eating healthy food and exercising before breakfast made you a weird “health nut.” 
That attitude didn’t exactly encourage people to take care of themselves. 
Today things are different. People want to be seen as physically fit.   And that’s because social norms have changed. 
So psychological and social factors can influence our choices, but they don’t cause or prevent the health problem.  
Any of us can reduce our own risk, and make low-risk choices regardless of our personality or social group. 

Now, it’s time to test your understanding of the concepts we’ve just learned.  Watch this video clip; there will be a few questions about it afterwards.

		 Meet Joe.  Joe means well, but he doesn’t always eat healthy food.
Greasy takeout last night, pizza today— Joe's usually up late, surfing the web with the help of a case of cola and a bag—or two—of chips.   
In fact, just about the only time Joe and his friends get their heart rate up is during an especially competitive video game.
