        <br/>
	 Let’s summarize. Everything that occurred in the Yellow and Orange Phases may also occur in the Red Phase but more intensely.  <br/>
The Red Phase is characterized by addiction.  <br/>
And the primary experience of addiction is loss of control. This means once we start using, we cannot consistently predict when we will stop.  <br/>
More intense psychological dependence also occurs. So our sense of relationship and defense of choices become stronger.   <br/>
By the time people reach the Red Phase, their tolerance level is high enough for them to cross their trigger level. In the early part of the Red Phase, there may continue to be an increase in tolerance. But once a person enters the late Red Phase, there may be a decline in tolerance because the body is simply breaking down.  <br/>
Memory blackouts occur more frequently and last longer in the Red Phase. And they may happen without any signs of impairment.  <br/>
Varying degrees of withdrawal may or may not occur in the Red Phase. Withdrawal is the experience of my body trying to adjust and function without alcohol or drugs.   <br/>
People are more likely to experience problems in the Red Phase. These can range from subtle problems, such as not being sharp at work, problems with family and friends, legal problems… even injury or death.
