	   The risks we can change are the choices we make every day… like smoking, diet and exercise. 
On the other hand, the risks we cannot change are related to our biology.  
Biologicial risk is determined by our inherited genetic makeup.  
Our biological risk… plus the risk created by the choices we make…. equals our total level of risk for heart disease.
