	   Remember, there are two types of problems that people might experience: impairment problems and health problems.
Problems are rare in the Green Phase, not uncommon in the Yellow Phase, very common in the Orange Phase, and almost always present in the Red Phase.
As we progress through the phases, we increase the quantity and frequency of our high-risk choices, thus increasing the risk for health and impairment problems.
Health problems become likely when we make high-risk choices over a period of months or years. This can include damage to any organ and includes risk for addiction, which arises from changes to the brain â€“ not always damage to the brain itself, but damaged brain functions.
Impairment problems can happen any single time we are impaired. The more often we become impaired, the more likely we are to experience impairment problems.
We can think of an impairment problem like the number six on dice. It might happen the first time or it might happen the 57th time; but sooner or later, if I keep tossing the dice, the six will turn up.
