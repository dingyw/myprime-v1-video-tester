      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:12.75">NARRATOR: First we have the risks we cannot change—biological. Biology sets our trigger level. And then, we have risks we can change—our choices. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:16.00">NARRATOR: High-risk choices increase the risk of hitting our trigger level. Low-risk choices reduce our risk for heart disease. Because we all have a different level of biological risk, low-risk choices are not the same for everyone.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: Psychological and social factors influence our choices—but do not cause or prevent the health problem. Our choices interact with our biology to determine the outcome.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: If we make enough high-risk choices, heart disease will develop no matter what kind of person we are. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:15.00">NARRATOR: On the other hand, if we understand our level of risk, and know what heart specialists have recommended as low-risk choices, we can reduce our risk for heart disease by consistently following those guidelines.</p>
