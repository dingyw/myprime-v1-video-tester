        <br/>
	   First we have the risks we cannot change—biological.  Biology sets our trigger level. 
And then, we have risks we can change—our choices.  High-risk choices increase the risk of hitting our trigger level.  Low-risk choices reduce our risk for heart disease.  
Because we all have a different level of biological risk, low-risk choices are not the same for everyone. 
Psychological and social factors influence our choices—but do not cause or prevent the health problem. 
Our choices interact with our biology to determine the outcome.  If we make enough high-risk choices, heart disease will develop no matter what kind of person we are.  
On the other hand, if we understand our level of risk, and know what heart specialists have recommended as low-risk choices, we can reduce our risk for heart disease by consistently following those guidelines.
