	   So, if I’ve progressed to the point of addiction, and I’ve got all these things going on… what are my options?

	   Well, one option is to just continue using. Another option would be to begin abstaining, in which case I can being regaining some of the things I value most in life.

	   So, if I'm in the Red Phase, I can seek help, stop my drinking or drug use, and put my life back together. It’s hard work, but millions of people have done it.

	   But people often need help.

	   They do. And they do because the brain changes. These are powerful changes that create both the psychological dependence and the physical addiction. 
So when somebody enters into recovery early on, it's just about clearing the body of the alcohol or drugs. But then long-term recovery can begin, and they can start reversing the brain changes.

	   But of course, this process takes time. Many people in the Red Phase are going to need some professional support as well as a lot of help from the people around them in order to succeed. But if I'm in the Red Phase, I can find support through Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other support groups.

	   There’s so much to think about. We’ve digested a whole lot of information about the progression. At this point-- what would you most want people to remember about the phases? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

        <br/>
	   One important thing to remember is that for different people, or different drugs, the trigger level can actually be higher or lower than we’ve illustrated. So, for some people, the progression from high-risk choices into addiction could actually happen more quickly if their trigger level is lower, or if they’re using a different substance. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty:</b>
        <br/>
	   And once I've entered the Red Phase, the only low-risk choice that remains for me is total abstinence--because the progression at this point is irreversible. For anybody who has not yet crossed their trigger level, the progression is reversible, so long as they make a commitment to following their low-risk guidelines. So when you think about it, people in the Orange Phase are at a particularly critical point in their lives, because if they do not return to the Green Phase by making low-risk choices, by default they progress to the Red Phase.
