	   I actually did a couple of silly things. First I thought "I'll solve this, I'll get everyone off my back." He challenged me, and said he bet I couldn't stop drinking for one week. And I said, "yes I can." It was the most miserable week of that man's life. I was on purpose just a bratty awful thing. The day after the week, I was in the grocery store, buying the bottles, brought them home and said, "See, I told you so." That was sort of silly. Then I thought a couple months later, "I'll buy some non-alcoholic wine, because maybe it's just a habit." And because I'm an alcoholic and I'm really crafty, I thought, "I could put real wine in the non-alcoholic bottles, and nobody will know the difference." A couple of days after that he asked how come I was still slurring and stumbling around if it's non-alcoholic, and I remember sitting across the table from him and asking if he wanted a glass. I remember pouring it and lying straight to his face. He knew everything, but I would just lie straight to his face. I would hide bottles, and part of my morning routine was seeing what was left and--I would hide them in different places, and again, think I'm really crafty--and he made a piece of paper and he typed out, "Do you really think I'm that stupid that I don't know what you're doing?"

		 An alcoholic is gonna find booze no matter where he is. It becomes one of those situations where you think, two people are stranded on an iceberg in the middle of the ocean, and the alcoholic will find something to drink. That's what happens in the military--you have standing order #1, no drinking in the theater of operations, but there's a lot of drinking that goes on where they are.

	   It got to the point where I was drinking at home all the time. I wasn't out any more, I wasn't sociable any more. My day ended at 5:00, because that's when I started drinking. It got to the point where I was hiding, and I was drinking mass quantities in short periods of time.
