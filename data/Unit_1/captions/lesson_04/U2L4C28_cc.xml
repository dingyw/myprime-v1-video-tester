        <br/>
	   As long as we’re following the 0-1-2-3 guidelines, we’re in the Green Phase. The hallmark of the Green Phase is low-risk choices.
High-risk choices are the hallmark of the Yellow Phase, and they continue to be a foundation for each of the remaining phases.
In the Orange Phase, high-risk choices are joined by psychological dependence. This hallmark of the Orange Phase causes alcohol and drugs to take on a central role in our lives.
And in the Red Phase we add addiction. This hallmark means we lose the ability to consistently make low-risk choices—even if we want to.
