	   In the formula for lifestyle-related health problems, “Choices” refers to both quantity and frequency—how much and how often we choose behaviors that can increase or decrease our risk for heart disease. 
When those choices push us closer to our trigger level, we call them high-risk choices.
Choices that aren’t likely to trigger health problems are called low-risk choices. 
Heart specialists have put together research-based guidelines for preventing heart disease.  Here are the American Heart Association’s guidelines.  You’ve probably heard a few of these before.
Exercise aerobically for at least 30 minutes a day…. on most days. 
Don’t smoke.
Eat six servings of fruits and vegetables every day.
Eat no more than six ounces per day of lean meat, fish, or skinless poultry. 
Bake, broil or roast foods instead of frying them. 
Use vegetable oils instead of animal fats or butter.
