	   As we’ve progressed through the phases of high-risk use, we’ve seen how alcohol advertisers target drinkers in the Yellow and Orange Phases with specific messages that are very carefully crafted. Let’s now take a look at the kinds of messages they use to appeal to people in the Red Phase. Here’s Jean Kilbourne.

	   The Red Phase is marked by increasing use of alcohol or drugs, increasing preoccupation, and decreasing control. Most people in this phase are aware on some level that something is wrong. Many are experiencing some anxiety, even dread. They have probably experienced many relationship and/or work problems. They have jeopardized and probably lost some of the things they value in life. The alcohol advertisers want to allay this anxiety. The best way to do this is to make heavy drinking and the symptoms of trouble seem normal. This reassures people in the Red Phase that their drinking is perfectly okay, not a problem. After all, everyone drinks like this. Everyone is obsessed with alcohol.
In the Red Phase, the love affair with alcohol that began in the Orange Phase becomes even more intense. To make this seem normal, advertisers sometimes present the bottle as a religious icon and drinking as a spiritual experience:
“Absolut sanctity.”
“Bourbon so extraordinary, we built a glass shrine around it.”
“Absolut awe.”
By the Red Phase, the drinker feels that alcohol has enormous power in his or her life. This is sometimes reflected in the ads:
"It controls the weather." 
In this ad, the alcohol creates a sunny space within a rainstorm.
"It watches your back."
Here the bottle is able to transport the drinker out of a dull party onto a tropical beach.

	   As alcohol plays an increasingly important role in our lives, this is symbolized in ads by extreme close-ups of the bottle and the drink and loving shots of the drink being poured:

	   Remember the images from earlier in the program of the brain lighting up in response to a picture of alcohol?  This happens to people in the Orange and Red Phases. Advertisers do this research too and they are well aware of psychological cues that make people want to drink … such as close-ups of the drink, foam running over the side of a beer mug, the amber warmth of a glass of whiskey.
These ads and commercials take a light-hearted look at loss of control and the damage that can result by making the excitement over alcohol seem funny and normal.

	   Eventually alcohol replaces everything else in our lives:
“How to pack for the weekend.”
“All we need is alcohol.”
The enslavement of addiction is vividly symbolized in ads featuring chains around the bottle or the drinker:
The barbed wire is not only a symbol of addiction, it's also a clear sign of protecting the supply.
“Absolut security.”
“Absolut freedom.”
This loss of control sometimes leads to acts that are tragic. It often leads to shame and regret. As always, the ads minimize and normalize this too:
"On the town. Off the hook. What happens here stays here." 
“The holiday office party. Birthplace of many awkward Mondays.”
While the ads normalize the experiences of each Phase and the problems that accompany them, they don’t address either the destruction of the phase or the hope that can lie ahead. There can be a happy ending to this story. Let’s look at how people can bring a successful conclusion to the Red Phase.
