	   The risks for lifestyle-related health problems can be divided into two categories:  risks we can change, and risks we cannot change.   We deal with both types of risk every day. 
Right now, the sun is shining…  
But the forecast calls for rain.   And unfortunately, I cannot control the weather.  But if I choose to carry an umbrella…
I can avoid getting wet.  That’s a risk I can change.  On the other hand, I can't avoid lighting striking my umbrella or the wind blowing it away.  
To get a better idea how this applies to heart disease… we’re going to get some help from a doctor.

		 I’m with Dr. Virginia Colliver, a cardiologist and representative for the American Heart Association.  Dr. Colliver, thank you for joining us.

		 Thank you for having me. Please step on the treadmill.

		 <br />
		 Sure. So Dr. Colliver, since heart disease is a lifestyle-related health problem, are there things we can all do to reduce our risk for developing it?

      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

		 Sure many of the risk factors for heart disease are controllable.  
      </p>

		 For example, I can control what I eat every day...

		 Right, that’s one of them.  But there are many things you can do to prevent or decrease your chances of developing heart disease and having a heart attack.   Here at the American Heart Association we publish a list of cardiac-related risks.  Some of them you can control and others you can’t.

		 Interesting, I wonder which risks our learners think they can control?
