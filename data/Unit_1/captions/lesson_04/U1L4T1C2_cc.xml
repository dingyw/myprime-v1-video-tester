      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:11.75">ANTONIO: The risks for lifestyle-related health problems can be divided into two categories: risk we can change, and risk we cannot change. We deal with both types of risk every day.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:02.50">ANTONIO: Right now, the sun is shining... </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: But the forecast calls for rain.  And unfortunately, I cannot control the weather. But if I choose to carry an umbrella...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: I can avoid getting wet. That's a risk I can change. On the other hand, I can't avoid the posibility of lighting striking my umbrella or the wind blowing it away. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: To get a better idea how this applies to heart disease... we're going to get some help from a doctor.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: I'm with Dr. Virginia Colliver, a cardiologist and representative for the American Heart Association. Dr. Colliver, thank you for joining us.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:02.50">DR. COLLIVER: Thank you for having me. Please step on the treadmill.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Sure. So Dr. Colliver, since heart disease is a lifestyle-related health problem, are there things we can all do to reduce our risk for developing it? </p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:04.00">DR. COLLIVER: Sure many of the risk factors for heart disease are controllable.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: For example, I can control what I eat every day...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:09.00">DR. COLLIVER: Right, that's one of them. But there are many things you can do to prevent or decrease your chances of developing heart disease and having a heart attack.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:19.00" dur="00:00:08.00">DR. COLLIVER: Here at the American Heart Association we publish a list of cardiac-related risks. Some of them you can control and others you can't.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Interesting, I wonder which risks our learners think they can control?</p>
