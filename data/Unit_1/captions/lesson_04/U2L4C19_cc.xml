	   Yes, but in the Red Phase it becomes much more profound and actually takes on a different nature.

	   Remember those key elements to psychological dependence described in the Orange Phase?
One of those key puzzle pieces was something we referred to as “integration into life.”

	   Right, so by the time someone moves into the Red Phase, the alcohol and drugs have become so integrated, that if I was forced to choose between the high-risk choices and protecting the things I value, it is very hard to predict what I’d do. Now early on, people may choose to protect the relationship, so they’ll give up the high-risk choices. Later on, almost anything can lose out to the high-risk use.

	   Right, and for many people in the Red Phase, they wind up losing things that they value a great deal until they finally reach the point where the cost is just too great and they actually stop.

	   And of course the external circumstances in my life were just completely out of control and falling apart, I didn't have a real job... at that point in my drinking, I didn’t have a lot of friendships because people had just fallen away. I was very isolated, and whenever people would ask me to do things, or try to be involved in my life, I would say no, or more often than not find an excuse to cancel plans with people. I was very isolated and felt very alone. And, I think outwardly, people, if they had seen or knew what they were looking at, would have said, "This is a person who is in trouble. He's constantly isolated. He doesn't have meaningful relationships with people in his life. He doesn't have the external structure that [for me now] makes life worth doing." And, so, those things happening in combination with my drinking and all the depression I was experiencing around these things really left me in a position where I just felt empty.

	   I had gotten to the point where the alcohol for me was the... I use the word reward, but it really wasn't, it was a part of me. It was... I didn't know how to function without it, I didn't know how to live with that "reward," as I called it, at 5 o'clock. It got pretty bad.
