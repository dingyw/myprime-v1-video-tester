      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">NARRATOR: Another way to think of a trigger level is like a thermostat on an air conditioner. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: Only it's a thermostat that can't be changed. Just as the A/C kicks on more quickly when it's set to a lower temperature... If a person has a lower trigger level, heart disease develops more easily for them. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: For example, those who have a parent with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves. The younger the parent was when their heart problems began, the greater the risk for the adult children. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: So, as you can see, different people have different levels of biological risk, but everyone has some risk, and everyone has a trigger level.</p>
