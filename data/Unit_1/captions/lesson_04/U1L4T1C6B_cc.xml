	   Another way to think of a trigger level is like a thermostat on an air conditioner. 
Only it’s a thermostat that can’t be changed.
Just as the A/C kicks on more quickly when it’s set to a lower temperature…
If a person has a lower trigger level, heart disease develops more easily for them.
For example, those who have a parent with heart disease are more likely to develop it themselves.  
The younger the parent was when their heart problems began, the greater the risk for the adult children. 
So, as you can see, different people have different levels of biological risk, but everyone has some risk, and everyone has a trigger level.
