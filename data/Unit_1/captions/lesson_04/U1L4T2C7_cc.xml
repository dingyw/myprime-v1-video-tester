	   Okay, I think we’ve got it now.
Our level of biological risk—our trigger level—might suggest making that we make more conservative choices than others make, especially if I have a very low trigger level.  
      </p>

	   Exactly.
      </p>

	   So what's considered “low-risk” for some people might not apply to someone who has a strong family history of heart disease?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Dr. Colliver: </b>
        <br/>
	   That’s right.  Or if, for example, a person trouble controlling their cholesterol with their diet, they may need different guidelines.  Some people even need medications to help prevent heart disease. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   So, what about people who already have heart disease? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Dr. Colliver: </b>
        <br/>
	   Good question.  They’d need to follow a different set of guidelines, as well.  The basic recommendations are intended to reduce the risk in people that don’t already have heart disease.
And again, if your biological risk is greater, then you would need to make even lower risk choices to reduce the likelihood of disease. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   So it’s good to know how much biological risk you have, so you can do something about it.  I mean, people who end up with heart disease didn't intentionally set out to pass their trigger level. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Dr. Colliver:</b>
        <br/>
	   Right.  They make high-risk choices, without knowing it, hoping or believing that heart disease won’t happen to them. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Or, maybe they don’t think about their choices and the consequences at all.
