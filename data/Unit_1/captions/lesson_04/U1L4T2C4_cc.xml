	   Consider 3 people with the following risk profiles. 
Person 1 was born with standard biological risk, or a standard trigger level for heart disease.
Person 2 has a family history of heart disease, so he has increased biological risk. 
And Peron 3 was born with even greater biological risk, and has an even lower trigger level.
