	   Now, let’s make sure this list really captures what you care about.  Take some time to pesonalize it by typing in a few specifics.
You can make it a little more real by putting in the names of your family or friends. 
And if you want to swap values out, that’s okay too.  For example, if you’re in a band you might change an item on the list to “music”.
When you’re finished, the list should have ten values that reflect the most important things in your life.
