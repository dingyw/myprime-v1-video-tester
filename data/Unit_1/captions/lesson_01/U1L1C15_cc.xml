	   None of us wants to lose what we value.  I know I sure don’t.  
But the experience you’ve just gone through is much closer to real life than many of us would like to think. 
When we make high‐risk alcohol or drug choices, we can lose a lot, just as you imagined in the activity. 
But, unlike the activity, in real life we don’t get to choose which things we will lose.  The first thing to go might be the one thing we cherish most.
