      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.25">ANTONIO: None of us wants to lose what we value. I know I sure don't.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:04.50" dur="00:00:06.50">ANTONIO: But the experience you've just gone through is much closer to real life than many of us would like to think.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: When we make high‚Äêrisk alcohol or drug choices, we can lose a lot, just as you imagined in the activity.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: But, unlike the activity, in real life we don't get to choose which things we will lose. The first thing to go might be the one thing we cherish most.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so you know when you're in the check-out lane at the grocery store and see your favorite candy next to the register?</p>   
	  <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Even if you're on a budget, or a diet, you might just grab it. Because an impulse-buy can taste pretty good.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Well, sometimes we make similar choices when it comes to drugs or alcohol. We just want something now, or feel like having fun.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: We might say "Just this once."  And then, if nothing bad happens, "Okay, just one more time." </p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:02.50">ANTONIO: And we might get away with it for a while.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: But if we keep it up, sooner or later we might hurt ourselves, or someone we care about.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Of course, we don't plan for bad things to happen in our lives. No one wakes up on a beautiful Friday morning saying, "I think I'll get a DUI today!"</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: We may think we are only choosing to have one more beer, to get high, or to have fun with our friends. We don't choose the problems. Why would we?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And because we never plan to experience problems... </p> 
      <p begin="00:01:30.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: We're likely to believe that when bad things do happen, it's a fluke. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: But over time, we can lose the things that are most important to us. </p> 
      <p begin="00:01:39.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: I might hurt my career. My health could deteriorate. My friends and family may leave. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DUSTIN, US ARMY SOLDIER: Cause no one ever thinks about that when they start using, no one ever thinks about what they can lose.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:50.00" dur="00:00:04.00">DUSTIN, US ARMY SOLDIER:	I mean they do to some extent, like oh I might get in trouble or go to jail. </p>
	  <p begin="00:01:54.00" dur="00:00:08.00">DUSTIN, US ARMY SOLDIER: But they never will be like well I could be the direct result of my little sister dying in a car crash that I was driving the car and drinking.</p>	  
	  <p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: If we want to keep the things we love, we have to make choices that protect them. And that might take a new kind of thinking.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: We already do this in a lot of ways. You know how we change the oil in our cars to keep the engine working? Or... it's just like brushing our teeth every day.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:18.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: In this course, we're going to explore how to make similar choices with drugs and alcohol. Choices that protect the things we value most.</p>
