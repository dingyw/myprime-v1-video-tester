			<p begin="00:00:06.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Now, if I were to ask 5 people which they valued more, this one dollar bill, or a crisp twenty...</p>

			<p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:03.50">ANTONIO: I think you'd have a pretty good idea what they'd say.</p>

			<p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:03.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: You think I'm stupid?	</p>

			<p begin="00:00:17.00" dur="00:00:05.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: The twenty... is this a trick question?</p>

			<p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:02.50">PERSON ON THE STREET: The twenty unless it's fake.</p>

			<p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:03.50">PERSON ON THE STREET: Oh I'd definitely value the twenty... can I keep it?</p>

			<p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:02.50">PERSON ON THE STREET: I'll take the twenty.</p>

			<p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: No big surprises there. But our values, the things we care about most, aren't always so easy to size up. And of course, we're all different.</p> 
					
			<p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:03.50">ANTONIO: So your values probably aren't going to be the same as mine.</p>

			<p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Our first activity will help you focus on the things that are most important to you.</p>
