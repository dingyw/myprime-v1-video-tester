We’re going to start by thinking about values—the things that are most important in our lives. 
Now, if I were to ask 5 people which they valued more, this one dollar bill, or a crisp twenty… I think you’d have a pretty good idea what they’d say.

		 You think I’m stupid?

			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
				<b>Person on the street:	</b><br/>
The twenty… is this a trick question?
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
				<b>Person on the street:</b><br/>
The twenty unless it’s fake.
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
				<b>Person on the street:</b><br/>
Oh I’d definitely value the twenty… can I keep it?
			</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
				<b>Person on the street:</b><br/>
I’ll take the twenty."

No big surprises there. 
But our values, the things we care about most, aren’t always so easy to size up. And of course, we’re all different. So your values probably aren’t going to be the same as mine.  
Our first activity will help you focus on the things that are most important to you."
