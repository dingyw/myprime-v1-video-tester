      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">ANTONIO: So, we've already talked a lot about impairment problems. But what we really want to know is how to prevent them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: And you've already got the formula for that. First, biology sets our level of risk for impairment problems, largely through our tolerance level.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ANTONIO: The second part of the equation is our choices. We know the low-risk guidelines—0,1,2,3—will help us to prevent both health problems and impairment problems.</p>
      <!-- <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: But there's only one part of the formula we can change, so our choices become critically important if we want to avoid impairment problems.</p> -->
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: When it comes to our choices, we've got to keep our eye on the ball, so to speak. Because if we get distracted by our surroundings or our beliefs...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: Well it doesn't take a genius to figure out what's going to happen next. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: For example, if we start to think alcoholism is a result of the type of person we are, we're not keeping our eye on the ball—our choices—and that's where our focus needs to be.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: It's the same with impairment problems. Some beliefs, like thinking impairment problems are "just bad luck," can distract us from staying focused on our choices.</p>
