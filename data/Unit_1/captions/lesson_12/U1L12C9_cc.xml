      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:06.75">NARRATOR: As blood alcohol level goes up, the risk for a crash goes up. And the risk for a fatality is much higher.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: This increased risk for crashes and fatalities begins at a blood alcohol level below the legal limit, as shown here.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:16.00">NARRATOR: You start to see an increased risk for crashes at a blood alcohol level of .035. By the time you get to a .12 blood alcohol level, the crash risk is 20 times greater than for someone who hasn't been drinking. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: For adolescents, the risk appears to increase at an even lower blood alcohol level than for adults.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: And just riding with a sober driver doesn't eliminate all risk. In a crash, an intoxicated passenger faces a much greater risk for death and permanent injury compared to a sober passenger.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: There are a few reasons for this. Those who died in crashes were less likely to be using seat belts. Alcohol also reduces clotting, so there is more likely to be more bleeding and swelling. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Additionally some life-saving surgical procedures and medications like anesthesia can't be administered due to a high blood alcohol level. </p>
