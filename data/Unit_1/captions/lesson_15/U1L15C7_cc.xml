        <br/>
	   We can prevent health or impairment problems by following the 0-1-2-3 Guidelines. 
Zero alcohol if we’re in recovery, and zero drugs. No more than one drink per hour. No more than two drinks daily. And no more than three on any one day. 
That’s a total of 14 drinks a week, but never more than three drinks in any one day. 
Anytime we average more than two drinks a day, we increase our risk for health and impairment problems. 
And, on any day we drink more than three standard drinks, we are making a high-risk choice. 
Drinking more than 1 standard drink per hour also increases our risk for problems. 
The higher the quantity and frequency above two drinks per day, the greater the risk for health and impairment problems. 
Although some people who drink within the low-risk range may still develop problems, most people who consistently drink within the 0-1-2-3 range will not.
Zero, or abstinence, is always a low-risk choice for alcohol. And abstinence is the only low-risk choice for drugs.
