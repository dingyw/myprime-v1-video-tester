      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: But unlike our trigger level, our tolerance level can change over time. When we drink to the point of impairment, our body automatically increases our tolerance level.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: And a high tolerance makes us less sensitive to alcohol, so we are less aware of how impaired we are.</p>
