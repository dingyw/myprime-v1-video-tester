	   People tend to believe that alcoholism and addiction happen because of the kind of people we are, rather than the kind of choices we make. On top of that, most of us don't think of ourselves as the kind of person who can develop alcoholism. But as we’ve learned, everyone has some level of biological risk for developing alcoholism. 
The formula for alcoholism is the same one we use for other lifestyle-related health problems, like heart disease. The formula is Biology + Choices = Outcome, and Choices are affected by Psychological + Social Influences.
Our biology sets our trigger level. Some people have a standard trigger level. Other people have a lower trigger level because of increased biological risk.
The choices part of the formula refers to the quantity and frequency of drinking or drug use. Our choices are influenced by  psychological factors, such as our attitudes and personality, as well as social  factors, like our family and friends.
High-risk choices increase the risk for reaching our trigger level – and triggering alcoholism, drug addiction or other problems. Low-risk choices will not trigger alcoholism, drug addiction or other problems. While we cannot change our level of biological risk, we can change the risk created by our choices. And that will ultimately determine the outcome. What kind of person we are and why we drink or use is not as important as how much and how often we do it.
