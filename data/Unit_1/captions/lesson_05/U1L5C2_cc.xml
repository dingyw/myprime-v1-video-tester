	   As we saw earlier, most people believe they have some risk for heart disease. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Right.  And most people believe that could have heart disease or cancer, not alcoholism or drug addiction.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   So who would most people say does develop alcoholism? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Good question.  Most often we hear, “Not me!”
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Well that narrows it down a bit!
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, It’s the type of problem we think happens to someone else.  And that someone else probably doesn’t believe they'll develop it either.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Okay Michelle, time to get a straight answer. Our next exercise explores common views about the traits associated with alcoholism.
What kind of person do most people think develops alcoholism? 
Keep in mind, we are not asking what kind of person you think develops alcoholism, we’re asking you what you think most people would say.
