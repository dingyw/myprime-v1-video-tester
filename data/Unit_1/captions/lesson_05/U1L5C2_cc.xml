      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">ANTONIO: As we saw earlier, most people believe they have some risk for heart disease.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Right.  And most people believe they have heart disease or cancer, not alcoholism or drug addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: So who would most people say does develop alcoholism? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:03.00">MICHELLE: Good question.  Most often we hear, "Not me!"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.00" dur="00:00:02.50">ANTONIO: Well that narrows it down a bit!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:06.00">MICHELLE: Yeah, It's the type of problem we think happens to someone else.  And that someone else probably doesn't believe they'll develop it either.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Okay Michelle, time to get a straight answer. Our next exercise explores common views about the traits associated with alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: What kind of person do most people think develops alcoholism?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Keep in mind, we are not asking what kind of person you think develops alcoholism, we're asking you what you think most people would say.</p>
