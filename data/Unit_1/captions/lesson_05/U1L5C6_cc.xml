	   What about older people, I'm gonna add older people to my list. I mean, when you're young, you can drink a lot more, but when you're old, there's no way.

	   Older people?!  No, I think everybody would say criminals, cause, they're in jail for a reason.

	   Yeah, I would definitely agree with that.  What about celebrities though? I mean, they've got all that money, people throwing them drinks all the time, you're bound to get alcoholism that way.

	   So what you think about the list of words?  Does it surprise you? 
      </p>

	   Not at all.  It makes sense most people to believe this is the kind of person who develops alcoholism or drug addiction.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   Because of stereotypes they’ve seen or heard? 
      </p>

        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, and because of they’ve  own experiences.  For example, say I have a friend, and her mom and grandfather both have alcoholism, and then starts to have problems with her own drinking.  It feels like, to me, she's just living out a family tradition.
Or, here's another one. Say a person says they'll only have one or two drinks, but then they end up closing down the bar. Or once they open a bottle, they finish it. It feels like they're weak, or have no self control.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

	   Okay, so it makes sense that people would have these beliefs, but why does it matter?  
      </p>

        <b>Michelle:</b>

	   Well, it matters for a couple reasons and it really revolves around our choices.  First off, how many of us would look at that list and say, "yeah, that's me."
      </p>

	   Ugh, look at this guy. Weak, depressed loser with no self-esteem. Is he for real??
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, there aren’t many people who’d say they are a weak, depressed, loser with low-self esteem.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Right, so if I don't see myself on the list, I may feel like I don't need to worry. My choices don't matter.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Since so many people believe this list is true, there must be some accuracy to it, right? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Right, to check out if it's accurate or not, we need to look at one more question: “Is alcoholism and drug addiction caused by the kind of person I am or by the kind of choices I make?"
