      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so lets talk about what this research means.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:03.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: The first takeaway from this research is that heredity establishes our level of biological risk for developing alcoholism. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: But, alcoholism isn't completely determined by our genetics?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: That's correct. Some of us are biologically predisposed to developing alcoholism, but none of us are genetically predestined.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: So, just because I have an increased biological risk, doesn't mean that I'll definitely develop alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RAY: That's absolutely right. If you think back to those who had a birth parent with alcoholism, they were four times more likely to develop alcoholism themselves, but not all of them did.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:05.00">RAY: In fact, 80% of those with a family history of alcoholism did not develop it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: On the other hand, some who had no biological family history of alcoholism did develop it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: So, clearly, they were not immune...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: That's Right. What this research tells us is that all of us have some level of biological risk for developing alcoholism, some people have increased risk.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Okay. Thanks, Ray. If you're still curious, there's been further research on twins and alcoholism that can tell us even more about inherited risk.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: Visit this link to the resources section if you'd like to find out more.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:20.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: So Ray, what about drug addiction?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:05.00">RAY: Well, the original adoption research was done with just alcohol and alcoholism.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: Later research has shown that those who have a birth parent with alcoholism are also four times more likely to experience serious problems with drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:37.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RAY: And, even later research has gotten more specific, linking it to marijuana, to opiates such as morphine, to stimulants such as cocaine, and sedatives such as Valium.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: And what about people who didn't have a birth parent with alcoholism? </p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RAY: Well, while those who did have a family history were more likely to, still many people who develop drug addictions do not have any family history of either alcoholism or drug addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: So, just like alcoholism, drug addiction can happen to anyone?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:07.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: That's right. It can happen to anyone, some people have increased biological risk, and our family history can be a clue to our level of biological risk.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:16.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: Thanks, Ray.</p>
