	   Remember Joe? Now, instead of heart disease, let’s look at his risk for alcoholism and addiction.
Suppose we learn that Joe’s father had alcoholism. That would mean he has increased biological risk. 
To top it off, he is gregarious, impulsive, and has friends keep beer on tap all week, and throw “drink-’til-you-drop” keggers on the weekends. These psychological and social factors might influence him to make high-risk drinking choices.  If so, he might make very high-risk choices. And if he does, he is more likely to trigger alcoholism.
But, neither his level of biological risk nor his psychological and social influences will force him to make high-risk choices. He can protect himself by choosing to make low-risk choices instead.
