      <p begin="00:00:03.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ONLINE USER 2: Right, so if you have biological risk factors like heredity and high tolerance, than you have a higher risk.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:02.50">ONLINE USER 3: Biology sets the trigger level...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ONLINE USER 4: Yes, but biology alone doesn't determine whether I'll develop alcoholism... right?</p>	 
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: Right! Our biology establishes our level of risk, but it doesn't control whether or not we develop alcoholism or drug addiction. Choices are the other key piece of the formula.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: The principles we established for the development of heart disease are the same for the development of alcoholism and addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ANTONIO: Biology sets our trigger level. Some people have a standard trigger level. Other people have a lower trigger level, because they have increased biological risk. But, our level of biological risk isn't the only factor.</p>
