	   Well biology determines how much risk you have…

	   Right, so if you have biological risk factors like heredity and high tolerance, than you have a higher risk.

	   Yeah, but biology alone doesn’t determine whether I’ll develop alcoholism… right?

	   Right!  Our biology establishes our level of risk, but it doesn’t control whether or not we develop alcoholism or drug addiction. Choices are the other key piece of the formula.
The principles we established for the development of heart disease are the same for the development of alcoholism and addiction. 
Biology sets our trigger level.  Some people have a standard trigger level.  Other people have a lower trigger level, because they have increased biological risk.  But, our level of biological risk isn’t the only factor.
