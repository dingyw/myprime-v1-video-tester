      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, Ray. Let's do a quick review. So, we've learned that our biology establishes our level of risk, but it doesn't control whether or not we develop alcoholism or drug addiction. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: That's exactly right. Research shows us that heredity establishes our level of risk, but does not completely control whether we will develop alcoholism or drug addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Some of are genetically predisposed to develop alcoholism or drug addiction, but no one is predestined.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: And it's also useful to keep in mind that just as some people have lower trigger levels, some substances have lower trigger levels as well.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: What do you mean by that?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Well, it's just that we become more rapidly addicted to some substances compared to alcohol. This is especially true for nicotine, opiates, and for many stimulants.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Is it true for all illegal drugs?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Not for all illegal drugs, but it's common enough that we can think of it as a general principle for illegal drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Let's keep in mind though, that no matter what the substance, or no matter what our own level of biological risk, alcohol and drug-related problems don't happen by themselves.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Thanks, Ray. Now, let's check our understanding. How does heredity—our biology—play a role in whether or not we will develop alcoholism or addiction?</p>
