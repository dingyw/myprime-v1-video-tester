      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: At this point we've learned that anyone can develop alcoholism, but not everyone has the same level of risk. Do we know anything about what is inherited that increases risk?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: We do.  We learn about this by studying young adults who do not have alcoholism, and following them over time to see what happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Interesting. How so?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Well, some of the best research on this is being done by Dr. Marc Shuckit and his team at the University of California, San Diego.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: They were following two groups—one has a family history of alcoholism, the other does not.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: All of them were between the ages of 18 and 22 at the beginning of the study, and so far they've been following them for almost two decades.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, what did they find?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Well at the begining of the research, they found that the group that has a family history responded differently to alcohol in a number of ways. But just because they responded differently does not necessarily mean that difference is a risk factor.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So Ray, how can we tell?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: The only way to tell is to follow them for a long enough period of time, then you can begin to see which of the differences actually predict a higher rate of  problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Now so far, the research team has reported on the first 15 years. One of the first findings that they reported was that those with a family history of alcoholism developed four times more alcoholism themselves.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, now this is sounding familiar... The adoption research also showed four times increased risk for those with a family history.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: That's right. And this research added one more element. And that is, that they found those who had a high tolerance at the beginning of the research were also four times more likely to develop alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, one risk factor is a family history. And the other is high tolerance?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Yes— we now know of two risk factors, and they can be present in any combination. the risk factors are a family history, and high tolerance.  Some people have both. Some people have neither. And some people have one, but not the other.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, lets look at the results. We'll start with the group with neither risk factor-- those who didn't have a family history or high tolerance.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Over the first fifteen years, 21 percent of those who experienced neither risk factor developed serious problems with alcohol. Enough to interfere with their life.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: And this is the group with no increased biological risk? That seems like a lot.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: It is a lot, Antonio, but keep in mind this covered the heaviest drinking time in life, ages 20-35. Now not everybody in these two groups was making high-risk drinking choices, but a lot were.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: So, what these findings tell us is that even if we have no increased biological risk, we greatly increase our risk for alcohol problems if we make high-risk drinking choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: And what about the people who did have increased biological risk?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: For those that had one risk factor—either a family history or high tolerance—but not both, the rate was 36 percent.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So if they had one risk factor or the other, they were more likely to experience problems?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: That's right. And if they had both family history and high tolerance, the rate that experienced multiple health and impairment problems was 60 percent.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Wow, 60%. So they were significantly more likely to experience problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Yes, if they were making high-risk drinking choices.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: So to summarize: in this group where a lot of people were making high-risk drinking choices, over fifteen years, 21% of those with neither risk factor still experienced multiple health or impairment problems. </p>
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Of those that had one risk factor, it was 36%, and of those that had both risk factors, it was 60%.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so, anyone can have problem, but these findings help give us a mental picture of what it means to have increased biological risk. Thanks again, Ray.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Thank you Antonio, I'll see you later on.</p>
