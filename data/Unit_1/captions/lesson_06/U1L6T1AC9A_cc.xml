	   Yes! If the common belief were true, we would expect either to see no alcoholism in either group or the same low rates in both groups. 
However, the research indicated that as adults, those people who had a birth parent with alcoholism developed alcoholism four times more than those who did not have a birth parent with alcoholismâ€¦ even though they were all raised in homes without alcoholism. 
Based on the research, we now know that having a birth parent with alcoholism increases our biological risk.
