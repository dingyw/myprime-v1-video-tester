	   Interesting! You predicted that if the common view were true, we would expect to a higher rate of alcoholism in the group of adults who had a birth parent with alcoholism. 
Most people would say, however, that if the common view were true, we would expect to either see no alcoholism in both groups, or the same low rates in both groups, because the adoptees grew up with no alcoholism in their environment.
But guess what!  The research indicated that as adults, those people who had a birth parent with alcoholism did develop alcoholism at a higher rate, just as you predicted! In fact, these adoptees developed alcoholism four times more than those who did not have a birth parent with alcoholismâ€¦ even though they were all raised in homes without alcoholism.
Based on the research, we now know that having a birth parent with alcoholism increases our biological risk.
