	   One way research has tried to determine if psychological problems cause alcoholism or addiction, or are caused by it is to study the same people for many years. A group of researchers from Harvard University studied two groups of people for 50 years. None of the participants in the study had alcoholism when the research started. During the 50 years, the researchers interviewed the people every few years, keeping excellent records of what had happened in their lives and in what order events occurred. 
During this 50-year span, some people developed emotional problems, some people developed alcoholism, and some developed both. Within the group that developed both alcoholism and emotional problems, researchers found sometimes emotional problems came first and sometimes the alcoholism came first. But the alcoholism led to emotional problems more often than emotional problems led to alcoholism.
And other research has confirmed these findings. Some people drink or use drugs in response to stress or emotional problems. But it can just as easily go the other way. If you think about it, it makes sense that high-risk alcohol and drug choices can lead to emotional problems. Remember that alcohol and drugs change the brainâ€¦ which controls our emotions. So, if we are changing the part of our bodies that gives us our emotions, it makes sense one of the long-term outcomes can be emotional or psychological problems. 
Also, have you noticed sometimes when people drink or use drugs, their personalities change? They might become mean or depressed, or they might become nicer than usual! Typically, once they sober up, their personalities return to what they were. However, after enough use though, these changes can become more lasting and may continue till the person begins to make low-risk choices.
