	   So Michelle, I think most people are aware that social factors can influence a person’s drug and alcohol choices. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, I’d agree.  And we may only think certain kinds of social factors are important.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Like what? Give me an example. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Okay. Most of us think about social factors like poverty or maybe lack of education influencing rates of alcoholism or addiction.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   So, do those factors make a person more likely to experience problems? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   No, but it makes sense to believe that.  
Often people in these groups are just more visible.  They're arrested more often, or use more public services. So it feels like there's higher rates of alcoholism or addiction. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   So, it’s reasonable to believe… but is it true? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
   	   Well, studies show that alcoholism and addictionare common in all groups.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   So people from different nationalities, races, sexes, socioeconomic backgrounds, educational levels, and religions?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, pretty much all groups.  But social factors can also  influence our choices in ways that we may never imagine. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Okay, let’s explore that further.
