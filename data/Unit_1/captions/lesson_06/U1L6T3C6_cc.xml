      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: Yeah, the research lets us know we don't need  to have emotional  problems in order to develop alcoholism or drug addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, earlier, we made a list of the types of person most people would say would develop alcoholism. Are any of them accurate?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: Well, while there's no addictive personality type that causes alcoholism, research identified several personality traits that are more common among people who do.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay. I'm really curious to see what they are.</p>
