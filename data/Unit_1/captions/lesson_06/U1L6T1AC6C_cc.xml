      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:11.75">NARRATOR: Interesting! You predicted that If the common belief were true, we would expect to see no difference in the rates of alcoholism between adults whose adoptive parents did not have alcoholism,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:04.00">and adults who had an adoptive parent with alcoholism. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: Most people would say, however, that we would expect to see more alcoholism in those adults who had lived with parents who had alcoholism,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:05.00">because of the influence of growing up in an environment where alcoholism was present.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: But guess what! The research indicated that as adults, the two groups of adoptees actually had the same rate of alcoholism. Just like you predicted!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: This tells us that alcoholism does not run in families because of the effect of being raised by a parent who has alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: It also tells us that alcoholism can and does occur among people who have no family history of alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: So, why does alcoholism run in families, then? To answer that, let's look at the adoption research from a different direction.</p>
