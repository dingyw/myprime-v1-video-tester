	   Most people do not realize how truly amazing the human brain is. To get an idea, let’s compare it to something huge. Most astronomers say the known universe measured in cubic meters is 10 to the 87th power (1087). That’s the number 10 with 87 zeros after it. That’s more space that we can really imagine. Yet neuroscientists tell us that the billion or so cells in the human brain connect in so many ways, if we counted them all, they would equal 10 to the trillionth power. That is the number 10 with a trillion zeros after it. This is a number so large that if you wrote it out, putting down two zeros every second non-stop, it would take you over fifteen thousand years just to write the number. That is more time than all of recorded human history. Your brain is the most complex thing in the known universe.It receives and processes everything coming in through your five senses and it produces everything you think, feel, say or do. In the meantime, it managess  your body, making sure you breathe, blink, eat, drink and sleep. All of these parts of your brain work together. You brain isn't just a finely tuned instrument, it is a finely tuned orchestra and it is playing a work of art called YOU.
