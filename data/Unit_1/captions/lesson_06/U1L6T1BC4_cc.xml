      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:7.75">NARRATOR: The human brain is truly amazing. To get a better idea of how complex it is, let's compare it to something really huge.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:7.00">NARRATOR: Most astronomers believe the size of the known universe is approximately 10 to the 87th power cubic meters.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: That's the number 10 with 87 zeros after it and it's more space that we can really imagine.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: But neuroscientists tell us that the billion or so cells in the human brain connect in so many ways, that if we counted them all, the number of connections would equal 10 to the trillionth power.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:04.00">NARRATOR: That's the number 10 with a trillion zeros after it. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: This is a number so large that if you wrote it out, putting down two zeros every second non-stop, it would take you over fifteen thousand years just to write the number.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: That is more time than all of recorded human history. Your brain is the most complex thing in the known universe. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:16.00">NARRATOR: It receives and processes everything coming in through your five senses and it produces everything you think, feel, say or do. In the meantime, it managess your body, making sure you breathe, blink, eat, drink and sleep.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: All of these parts of your brain work together. You brain isn't just a finely tuned instrument, it is a finely tuned orchestra and it is playing a work of art called YOU.</p>
