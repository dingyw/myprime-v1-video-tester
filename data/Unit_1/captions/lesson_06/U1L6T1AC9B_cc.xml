      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: Actually, most people would say, however, that if the common view were true, we would expect either to see no alcoholism in both groups or the same low rates in both groups,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:04.00">because the adoptees grew up with no alcoholism in their environment.</p>
