	   Let’s take a closer look.  You predicted that if the common belief were true, we would expect to see more alcoholism in those adults who had birth parents with no alcoholism. 
Most people would say, however, that if the common view were true, we would expect either to see no alcoholism in both groups or the same low rates in both groups, because the adoptees grew up with no alcoholism in their environment.
However, the research indicated that as adults, those people who had a biological family history of alcoholism developed alcoholism four times more than those who did not have a biological family history… even though they were all raised in homes without alcoholism. 
Based on the research, we now know that having a birth parent with alcoholism increases our biological risk.
