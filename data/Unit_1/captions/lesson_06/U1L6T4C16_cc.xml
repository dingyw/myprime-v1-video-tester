	   Without clear guidelines for low-risk quantity and frequency choices, many people make high-risk choices, believing they drinking are “moderately,” or “responsibly.” 
And if I have increased my biological risk, those high-risk choices are more likely to trigger alcoholism.  
But I have the power to affect my outcome.  If I understand my risk, and I know what “low-risk” is for me, I can protect myself by choosing to make low-risk choices.
