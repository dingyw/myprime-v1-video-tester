	   Let’s say these first two symbols represent large numbers of birth parents who decide to place their babies up for adoption. None of these people have alcoholism. 
The next two symbols represent large numbers of adoptive parents. The adoption agencies don’t know it, but some of them have alcoholism. This one represents the adoptive parents who do not have alcoholism. And this one represents the adoptive parents who do have alcoholism. Got it? 
Now, these two symbols represent large numbers of children adopted by these parents.  Remember, none of these children have birth parents with alcoholism.  
This one represents those children whose adoptive parents do not have alcoholism. And this one represents those children who do have an adoptive parent with alcoholism.
