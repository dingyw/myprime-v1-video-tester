      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">NARRATOR: These people all have different levels of biological risk, or trigger levels. Remember the higher the level of biological risk, the lower the trigger level.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: The first person has no known biological risk factors for increased risk. They have no family history and do not have a high tolerance. We could think of their trigger level as being standard or average. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: The second person has increased biological risk, maybe one close relative with alcoholism or drug addiction. We could think of this increased risk as a lower trigger level.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: The third person has multiple family members with alcoholism or addiction. So it is likely this person has a very low trigger level.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: In addition to their individual trigger levels, each person was born with an initial tolerance level. </p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Tolerance levels vary from person to person. Here the lower line represents tolerance level.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: People who have a standard trigger level tend to also have a standard tolerance level. </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: Remember from the research we just reviewed, people who have a lower trigger level are likely to have a higher tolerance level. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: And those with an even lower trigger level tend to have an even higher tolerance level.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: The principles are going to be the same for alcohol or drugs, but to make it simple, let's use alcohol as an example.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:18.00" dur="00:00:04.00">NARRATOR: People become impaired when they drink a high-risk quantity that exceeds t1eir tolerance level.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:22.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Using these three people as examples, you can see that this person has the highest tolerance level.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: They are the one who will be able to drink the most before becoming impaired and they probably feel particularly good about their ability to really "handle" alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: But there's a catch. This person also has the lowest trigger level. In other words, this person is likely to develop alcoholism more quickly with high-risk drinking.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:48.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Let's look at these three over time. Assume all three typically drink until they are impaired. </p> 
      <p begin="00:01:54.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: This means they are all at risk for impairment problems. But, another danger is that their tolerance levels will increase.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: There is an important difference between a person's trigger level and their tolerance level. A person's trigger level for alcoholism or drug addiction is quite stable. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:10.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Extreme stress or trauma may alter the addiction threshold, but there is little we can do to change it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:16.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: On the other hand, the tolerance level can and does change, depending on how much a person drinks or uses.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:22.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Each time a person drinks or uses drugs past their tolerance level, they not only become impaired, they also raise their tolerance level.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: If they continue drinking or using to the point of impairment, their tolerance level will increase again.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:36.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: As we can see here, after making high-risk choices over a period of time, the third person has already passed their trigger level, and has developed alcoholism or drug addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: As they continue to make high-risk choices, their tolerance levels will continue to go up. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Now, the second person's tolerance level is also high enough for them to drink enough to exceed their trigger level. Now, this person also has alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:01.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: Finally, if the first person continues to make high-risk drinking choices, they will raise their tolerance level to the point at which they too can drink enough to pass their trigger level, alcoholism will be triggered.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:13.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: This can happen even thought this person did not start out with increased biological risk.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:18.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: So here we see the dangers of increased tolerance. When people drink to the point of impairment, they face increased risk for an impairment problem.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:26.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: But, when they drink to the point of impairment often enough, they force their tolerance up. </p>
      <p begin="00:03:31.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: And the increased tolerance makes it possible for each of these people to drink enough to pass their trigger levels for alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:37.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: Most of us think of high tolerance as a sign of strength or as an abilityâ€” the ability to drink more.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:45.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: But this research makes it clear that high tolerance is actually a liability. In medical terms, it's a risk factor.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:51.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: Unfortunately, high tolerance looks like protection in the beginning because the person can drink so much before becoming impaired.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:58.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: However, it's clearly an indicator of increased risk, not decreased risk.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:04.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: Just as there is a trigger level for alcoholism or drug addiction, there is a trigger level for many other alcohol- or drug-related health problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:12.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: So, a person may pass their trigger level for alcohol-induced heart disease, cancer, pancreatitis, or cirrhosis, even if they have not yet triggered alcoholism or addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:23.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: Along the way, they may also experience a number of impairment problems such as arrests, injuries, or damaged relationships.</p>
