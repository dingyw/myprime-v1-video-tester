	   These people all have different levels of biological risk, or trigger levels.  Remember the higher the level of biological risk, the lower the trigger level.
The first person has no known biological risk factors for increased risk. This means they have no family history and do not have a high tolerance. We could think of their trigger level as being standard or average. 
The second person has increased biological risk, maybe one close relative with alcoholism or drug addiction. We could think of this increased risk as a lower trigger level. 
The third person has multiple family members with alcoholism or addiction. So it is likely this person has a very low trigger level.
In addition to their individual trigger levels, each person was born with an initial tolerance level. Tolerance levels vary from person to person. In this illustration, the lower line represents tolerance level. 
People who have a standard trigger level tend to also have a standard tolerance level. Remember from the research we just reviewed, people who have a lower trigger level are likely to have a higher tolerance level. 
And those with an even lower trigger level tend to have an even higher tolerance level.
The principles are going to be the same for alcohol or drugs, but to make it simple, let’s use alcohol as an example. People become impaired when they drink a high-risk quantity that exceeds their tolerance level. 
Using these three people as examples, you can see that this person has the highest tolerance level. 
They are the one who will be able to drink the most before becoming impaired and probably feel particularly good about their ability to really “handle” alcohol.
But there’s a catch. This person also has the lowest trigger level. In other words, this person is likely to develop alcoholism more quickly with high-risk drinking.
Let’s look at these three over time. Assume all three typically drink until they are impaired.  
This means they are all at risk for impairment problems. But, another danger is that their tolerance levels will increase.
There is an important difference between a person’s trigger level and their tolerance level. A person’s trigger level for alcoholism or drug addiction is quite stable. Extreme stress or trauma may alter the addiction threshold, but there is little we can do to change it. 
On the other hand, the tolerance level can and does change, depending on how much a person drinks or uses. Each time a person drinks or uses drugs past their tolerance level, they not only become impaired, they also raise their tolerance level.
If they continue drinking or using to the point of impairment, their tolerance level will increase again. 
As we can see here, after making high-risk choices over a period of time, the third person has already passed their trigger level, and has developed alcoholism or drug addiction.
As they continue to make high-risk choices, their tolerance levels will continue to go up.  Now, the second person’s tolerance level is also high enough for them to drink enough to exceed their trigger level. Now, this person also has alcoholism.
Finally, if the first person continues to make high-risk drinking choices, they will raise their tolerance level to the point at which they too can drink enough to pass their trigger level, alcoholism will be triggered. This can happen even thought this person did not start drinking with increased biological risk.
This helps illustrate the danger of increased tolerance. When people drink to the point of impairment, they face increased risk for an impairment problem.
But, when they drink to the point of impairment often enough, they force their tolerance up. And the increased tolerance makes it possible for each of these people to drink enough to pass their trigger levels for alcoholism.
Most of us think of high tolerance as a sign of strength or as an ability— the ability to drink more. 
But this research makes it clear that high tolerance is actually a liability. In medical terms, it’s a risk factor.
Unfortunately, high tolerance looks like protection in the beginning because the person can drink so much before becoming impaired. 
However, it’s clearly an indicator of increased risk, not decreased risk
Just as there is a trigger level for alcoholism or drug addiction, there is a trigger level for many other alcohol- or drug-related health problems.
So, a person may pass their trigger level for alcohol-induced heart disease, cancer, pancreatitis, or cirrhosis, even if they have not yet triggered alcoholism or addiction. Along the way, they may also experience a number of impairment problems such as arrests, injuries, or damaged relationships
