      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">ALLAN: Your brain is always changing, but new research has shown that high-risk alcohol or drug choices cause your brain to change in particular ways. </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ALLAN: We've already learned ways to protect the heart and blood vessels from heart disease. But to prevent alcohol or drug problems, here are three "brain-basics" to keep in mind:</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALLAN: First, high-risk alcohol and drug choices change the brain biologically.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ALLAN: Think about it. The main reason people use high-risk quantities of alcohol or drugs is to get altered feelings.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:34.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ALLAN: And these altered feelings and emotions are only possible because the drug changes the brain. Each high-risk choice alters the brain a little bit.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ALLAN: But if I do this over and over, some changes last longer, and can become more permanent.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ALLAN: Second, these brain changes lead to thinking and behaviors linked to alcohol and drug problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:57.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ALLAN: While the various drugs people use to get high all have different effects, they all share the ability to change the regions of the brain related to memory, feelings, and motivation to keep using the drug.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ALLAN: Let's look at what researchers found about how the brains of people making high-risk alcohol choices respond differently to images of alcohol than the brains of those making low-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ALLAN: Researchers watched the brain responses of two groups of young adults looking at a picture like this glass of beer.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:31.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ALLAN: The area highlighted in blue is where the brains of those making low-risk choices had more response. The only part of their brain more activated is what we use to stop ourselves from certain behaviors.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:44.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ALLAN: It's as if their brain saw the picture and said, "Oh yeah, beer; but not here, not now."</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALLAN: Where you see the orange and red is where the group making high-risk choices had greater response.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:57.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ALLAN: The parts of their brain we see activated here have to do with feelings, motivation, planning, and decision-making.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:05.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ALLAN: This group had a powerful response to the beer image, and their brain went on high alert; as if their brains were saying "I like it and I want it. How can I get it right now?"</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:16.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ALLAN: These brain responses can change our thinking and our choices. All drugs used for getting high lead to similar brain changes, and similar problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALLAN: The third "brain basic" to know is about the role of genetics. Let's take a look.</p>
