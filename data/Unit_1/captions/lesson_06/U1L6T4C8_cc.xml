	   As we can see, we are exposed to a lot of different social influences. Everything from movies to greeting cards to t-shirts, constantly tell us that drinking is a great way to celebrate, have fun, express ourselves or relieve stress. Alcohol advertisers constantly find new and unique ways to reinforce these messages.

Jean will periodically be joining us to show us how alcohol advertising illustrates the things we are learning.

	   Thanks Antonio, just about everyone feels personally exempt from the influence of advertising. Wherever I go, what I hear more than anything else is “I don’t pay attention to ads, I just tune them out, they have no effect on me.” However, we are each exposed to thousands of ads every day.  The alcohol industry alone spends over three billion dollars a year on advertising and promotion. Advertisers also spend billions of dollars on psychological research—mostly learning how to influence us subconsciously.
Consider the long-running and very popular Absolut vodka campaign. In the first year of this campaign, sales soared from 54,000 cases to 2.4 million cases.  What could possibly account for this other than the influence of advertising?  
The Absolut campaign is very clever and sophisticated– but it doesn’t give us any information about the product.  What it does do is create a powerful image – and people are willing to spend a lot of money in an attempt to buy this image – at the same time we all sincerely believe we are not influenced by advertising.  We are not brainwashed by advertisements, but it is hard to not be influenced.  Advertising’s influence is quick, cumulative and, for the most part, subconscious.
Many people believe there is such a thing as an “addictive personality.”While this isn’t true, we do know that there are several personality traits that influence drinking choices.  The alcohol industry knows this too. These personality traits include gregariousness, impulsivity, rebelliousness, and sensation-seeking. These traits show up again and again in alcohol advertising.
The gregarious person likes to be with people.  So many ads feature groups of happy people drinking together:
(Music playing and singing) ”Ice cold beer and I am thinking to myself… what a wonderful world.” 
Impulsiveness.  Many ads imply that alcohol will add spontaneity and excitement to our lives.  Some even promise:
“Spontaneity now available in a handy 4-pack.”
“Auditor by day, Bacardi at night.” In this ad he’s not only winning at the table, he’s scoring with the showgirls.
Rebelliousness.  This trait, more than any other, shows up in the research and, not surprisingly, in the ads.  Now this is tricky for advertisers.  They want us all to drink their brand as a sign of individuality – in other words, to conform in the name of uniqueness. Drinking this brand is not only our own personal choice.  It is a sign of our individuality and freedom.
Beefeater tells us, “A bold spirit always stands out.”
(Music plays) “At Miller we brew great tasting beer. Because you can get in line and take what they give you, or you can make your own choice. Miller.”
Another personality trait that can encourage high-risk drinking choices is sensation-seeking.  Some people have a great need to experience new things and seek lots of activity and stimulation. Ads suggest that alcohol is the perfect companion to exciting activities.  
(Music playing and singing) “Going into mountains…ain’t no mountain high enough aint’ no valley low, ain’t no river wide enough enough to keep me from you.  And if you need to call me no matter where you are, no matter how far, just call my name and I will be there in a hurry, ain’t no mountain high enough, nothing can keep me nothing can keep me from you, ain’t no mountain high enough….”
Once we become aware of how advertisers use psychological research to target us, we can never see the ads in quite the same way again. This gives us more power over the marketers.
