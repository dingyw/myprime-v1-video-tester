	   So if our biology is only one of the risks, and can’t cause these problems by itself, where does the rest of our risk come from? 
The answer is our choices. Whether our level of biological risk is high or low, addiction is triggered when we’ve made enough high-risk choices to exceed our trigger level. 
And the choices that we’re talking about here are the quantity and frequency of drinking or drug use— that’s how much and how often. 
If I make low-risk choices, I won’t trigger alcoholism, drug addiction, or other problems. But high-risk choices are likely to trigger problems. 
It takes less use for those with a lower trigger level.  And will take more use for those with a higher trigger level. But, the process is the same for everyone. As we saw with heart disease, our choices are the risks we can change.
