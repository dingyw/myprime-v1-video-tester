      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">ANTONIO: So if our biology is only one of the risks, and can't cause these problems by itself, where does the rest of our risk come from?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: The answer is our choices. Whether our level of biological risk is high or low, addiction is triggered when we've made enough high-risk choices to exceed our trigger level.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: And the choices that we're talking about here are the quantity and frequency of drinking or drug useâ€” that's how much and how often.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: If I make low-risk choices, I won't trigger alcoholism, drug addiction, or other problems. But high-risk choices are likely to trigger problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: It takes less use for those with a lower trigger level. And will take more use for those with a higher trigger level. But, the process is the same for everyone.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: As we saw with heart disease, our choices are the risks we can change. </p>
