	   Some people’s brains change more quickly than others because of genetics.  Their brains respond differently to alcohol or drugs and can influence them to use more or less of a substance. 
For example, in these images we see the brains of those whose parents did not have alcoholism respond more to monitor their emotions when they hear positive, negative or neutral words, than those with a family history of alcoholism
These are genetic differences before they use alcohol or any other drug.  And even without a family history, some people’s brains are just different. Those with a more sensitive brain, for example, those having more receptors, find stimulants unpleasant while those whose brains are less sensitive find the same drug to be pleasant.
Obviously, those who like a drug’s effects will do more to get and use it. Knowing our biological risk is important, and there are ways to determine it. 
But also, some people change their brains more quickly than others because of the type of drug they use, the dose they are taking and their frequency of use. The more potent the drug, the more I use on any one occasion and the more often I do it, the more rapidly my brain will change.
