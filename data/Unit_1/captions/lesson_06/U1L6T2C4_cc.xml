	   People tend to believe that alcoholism or addiction happens because of the kind of people we are, rather than the kind of choices we make. And most of us don’t believe we’re “that kind of person.”  This belief has led many people to make high-risk choices, and to ultimately pass their trigger level. 
This is especially important for people with a family history of alcoholism or drug addiction. They may look at their family members and say to themselves, “I’m never going be like that.” Yet they often end up with alcoholism or drug addiction themselves. Why? Maybe they had the mistaken belief that their family members became addicted because to some kind of weakness.  Or, they might have seen their own high tolerance as a sign of strength or proof they can handle it well.
And the whole time they’re making high-risk choices, they don’t realize that subtle but profound changes are taking place in their brains. Then one day they realize what’s happened to them, and they wonder why.
