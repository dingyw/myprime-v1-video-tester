	   So, once again, the question we want to answer is, “Are alcohol and drug problems caused by the kind of person I am, or the kind of choices I make?”
To answer that, let’s go back to the formula for lifestyle-related health problems, and look at what research can tell us about each piece of the equation. 
Research allows us to see beyond your experience or my experience, and look at the broad human experience, so we can see what is true for most people.
Remember the two components of lifestyle-related health problems?  First biology sets a trigger level, and then lifestyle choices trigger the problem.  Research tells us that alcoholism and drug addiction are lifestyle-related health problems.  So, we can prevent these problems by using the same type of thinking that works to prevent heart disease. 
Just like with heart disease, for alcoholism and drug addiction there are risks we cannot change—our biology.  And, there are risks can change—our choices.  
Together, our biology and choices will determine the outcome.
