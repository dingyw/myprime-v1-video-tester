      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">ANTONIO: So, once again, the question we want to answer is, "Are alcohol and drug problems caused by the kind of person I am, or the kind of choices I make?"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: To answer that, let's go back to the formula for lifestyle-related health problems, and look at what research can tell us about each piece of the equation.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Research allows us to see beyond your experience or my experience, and look at the broad human experience, so we can see what is true for most people.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Remember the two components of lifestyle-related health problems?  First biology sets a trigger level, and then lifestyle choices trigger the problem. </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: Research tells us that alcoholism and drug addiction are lifestyle-related health problems.  So, we can prevent these problems by using the same type of thinking that works to prevent heart disease. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: Just like with heart disease, for alcoholism and drug addiction there are risks we cannot change—our biology.  And, there are risks can change—our choices.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Together, our biology and choices will determine the outcome.</p>
