      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">ANTONIO: Sensation-seeking, gregarious, impulsive, rebellious... If those traits describe me... should I be a little worried?</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Well, to answer your question, let's think about how these traits could contribute to higher rates of alcoholism or addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Alright, so it's Wednesday night. Where are we going to find outgoing, spontaneous, rebellious high sensation-seekers?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: I'm thinking bars and parties.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:06.00">MICHELLE: Right. So the traits can influence where we socialize. And once there, do you think we might drink a little, or a lot?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: I'm thinking we're more likely to drink a lot.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Definitely. The traits describe people who get bored easily, or seek a lot of stimulation and excitement.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: But that's not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Not at all. Some of us harness the traits in a life-enhancing direction, and find success, at school or on the job. </p>
	  <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Others of us may not, and find ourselves in jail or maybe losing touch with things we really value.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: So it all comes down to how I respond to those traits?</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:04.00">MICHELLE: Exactly! Just because we have the traits, doesn't mean we'll make high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Got it, so being sensation-seeking, gregarious, impulsive, or rebellious doesn't cause alcoholism.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Right. But these traits can influence how much, or how often we drink or use drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: Got it. So, what If I don't have these traits? Does that mean I'm safe?</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:12.00" dur="00:00:07.00">MICHELLE: No, remember the traits just influence our choices. They're not the only traits that influence drinking or drug choices.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:19.00" dur="00:00:06.00">MICHELLE: Attitudes, values--those can also influence our decisions. Some of us drink or use because we're shy or socially uncomfortable.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And shy people aren't usually gregarious.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MICHELLE: Exactly. It all boils down to the kind of choices we make not the kind of person we are.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Okay, thanks, Michelle. Have you ever heard someone with alcoholism described as drinking to "drown their problems?"</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Well, in reality, research shows us that many people who develop addiction start out by drinking or using drugs for fun.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:49.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: People who believe drinking is a good way to have fun are likely to drink more. And people who drink more, experience more problems.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:59.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: The same is true for people who believe drinking or getting high is a normal thing to do when they're upset. </p> 
      <p begin="00:02:05.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: It makes them more likely to drink or use drugs to deal with emotions like stress, loneliness, or anger.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:12.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: But ultimately, we now know that why people drink, isn't as important as how much and how often they drink.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ROBERT: The thing i like is that they validate the nature vs. nurture argument. And it's a nice balance. A lot of pepople...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ROBERT: There's that stigma that the group that we talked about generally being the ones people asume have the problems, it's not always the lower class, it's not always, "Oh, I got problems."</p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ROBERT: It's the fact that anybody is prone to having these problems and it widens the spectrum for who all can be affected and therefore widens the blaim, the shame.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:56.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ROBERT: It makes it that there is less, it's like, "Hey I'm not the only one thats prone to this."</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:02.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ROBERT: Yeah my risk factors, I mean the fact that I have made higher risks, I mean the environment that I was raised in makes me more prone to developing a problem earlier but at the same time you could have,</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:13.00" dur="00:00:03.00">you are still just as likely to have that problem.</p>          	  
      <p begin="00:03:16.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ROBERT: I like the fact that it says it's anybody it's not just "Oh because I was born with alcoholism. It's in the family..." It's just that it's not that it's acceptable, it's not something to be so ashamed of.</p>        
      <p begin="00:03:30.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ROBERT: Cause it's your... Anybody can be... It can happen to anybody.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:34.00" dur="00:00:19.00">ROBERT: I like how it also, the onset of depression, stress and other problems, that that all is a product of the alcoholism and drug abuse and that it's not just... not the other way around.</p>
