	   Sensation-seeking, gregarious, impulsive, rebellious...  If those traits describe me… should I be a little worried?
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Well, to answer your question, let’s think about how these traits could contribute to higher rates of alcoholism or drug addiction. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   Okay.
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Alright, so it's Wednesday night. Where are we going to find outgoing, spontaneous, rebellious high sensation-seekers?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   I'm thinking bars and parties. 
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Right.  So the traits can influence where we socialize. And once there, do you think we might drink a little, or a lot?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   I'm thinking we’re more likely to drink a lot.
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Definitely.  The traits describe people who get bored easily, or seek a lot of stimulation and excitement. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. 
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Not at all.  Some of us harness the traits in a life-enhancing direction, and find success, at school or on the job. Others of us may not, and find ourselves in jail or maybe losing touch with things we really value.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   So it all comes down to how I respond to those traits? 
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Exactly!  Just because we have the traits, doesn’t mean we'll make high-risk choices. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   Okay, so being sensation-seeking, gregarious, impulsive, or rebellious doesn’t cause alcoholism. 
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Right.  But these traits can influence how much, or how often we drink or use drugs. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   Got it.  So, what If I don’t have these traits?  Does that mean I’m safe?
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   No, remember the traits just influence our choices. They’re not the only psychological traits that influence drinking or drug choices. Attitudes, values--those can also influence our decisions. Some of us drink or use because we're shy or socially uncomfortable. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   And shy people aren’t usually gregarious. 
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Exactly.  It all boils down to the kind of choices we make rather than the kind of person we are.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   Okay, thanks, Michelle.
Have you ever heard someone with alcoholism described as drinking to “drown their problems?”
Well, in reality, research shows us that many people who develop addiction start out by drinking or using drugs for fun.  
People who believe drinking is a good way to have fun are likely to drink more.  And people who drink more, experience more problems.  
The same is true for people who believe drinking or getting high is a normal thing to do when they’re upset.  It makes them more likely to drink or use drugs to deal with emotions like stress, loneliness, or anger. 
But ultimately, we now know that why people drink, isn’t as important as how much and how often they drink.
