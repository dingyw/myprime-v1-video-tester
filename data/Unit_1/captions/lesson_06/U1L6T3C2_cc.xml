      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">ANTONIO: Earlier we talked about how we don't make diet and exercise choices in a vacuum. And as you might guess, it's not any different when it comes to alcohol and drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Anyone who makes high-risk choices can develop alcoholism or drug addiction. But, not everyone is as likely to make high-risk choices.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Michelle Ellison from PRI is back to talk about the two major categories of things that influence our choices—psychological factors and social factors. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:02.50">ANTONIO: Michelle, thanks for joining us again.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:02.00">MICHELLE: Hey, good to be back Antonio. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.00" dur="00:00:02.50">ANTONIO: So let's start first with psychological factors.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MICHELLE: You know, right out of the blocks are psychological influences are an important part of who we are—they are things like our values, beliefs and personality.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Right, we talked about this earlier in relation to heart disease. If I believe that exercising is a waste of time, that's going to influence the choices I make.</p>	  
      <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:09.00">MICHELLE: Right. When it comes to the psychological factors that could influence high-risk choices, most of us think about things like stress, emotional problems, or maybe low-self esteem.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: I've also heard about "an addictive personality."</p> 	  
      <p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:02.00">MICHELLE: Yeah, that's another one.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: So, are they true?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:03.00">MICHELLE: For the most part, no. But there's just enough truth in there that it's misleading.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: How so?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:06.00">MICHELLE: Well, some people do drink or use drugs as a result of emotional problems. But the bigger question is—is it typical?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:19.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: That's a good question. We're going to explore it further.</p>
