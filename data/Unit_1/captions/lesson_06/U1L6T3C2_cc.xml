	   Earlier we talked about how we don’t make diet and exercise choices in a vacuum.  And as you might guess, it’s not any different when it comes to alcohol and drug choices. 
Anyone who makes high-risk choices can develop alcoholism or drug addiction.  But, not everyone is as likely to make high-risk choices.  
Michelle Ellison from PRI is back to talk about the two major categories of things that influence our choices—psychological factors and social factors. 
Hi Michelle, thanks for joining us again.  So, let’s start first with the psychological factors. 
      </p>

	   Good to be back Antonio.  You know, right out of the blocks, psychological influences are an important part of who we are—they are things like our values, beliefs and personality.
      </p>

        <b>Antonio:  </b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, we talked about this earlier in relation to heart disease.   
If I believe exercising is a waste of time, that’s going to influence the choices I make.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Right.  But when it comes to the psychological factors that could influence high-risk choices, most of us think about things like stress, emotional problems, or maybe low-self esteem.   
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   I’ve also heard about “an addictive personality.” 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, that’s another one.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   So, are they true? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:  </b>
        <br/>
	   For the most part, no.  But there’s just enough truth in there that it's misleading.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   How so?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle: </b>
        <br/>
	   Well, some people do drink or use drugs as a result of emotional problems.  But the bigger question is—is it typical?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   That’s a good question. We’re going to explore it further.
