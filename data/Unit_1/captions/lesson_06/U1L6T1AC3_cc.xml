      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">ANTONIO: Ray Daugherty, co-author of Prime for Life, is joining us to share some research that will help us understand why alcoholism runs in families. Ray, thanks so much for joining us.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: Hi Antonio. We're going to look at adoption research, because it's one of the best ways to understand why any particular trait runs in families.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:03.50">ANTONIO: Adoption research, okay... so what can that tell us?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: Quite a bit actually. When you think about it the typical family, the same parents give us both our biology and our home environment. </p>  
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: So, when we're trying to understand why something "runs in families"â€”it could be something like a sense of humor, or, alcoholism, it's really hard to tease that out,</p>   
	  <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:05.00">since the same parents gave us both home environment and biology.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:45.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Ok, I think I can see where this is going. When people are adopted at a young age, the people that gave birth to them and the people that raised them are different...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RAY: Exactly. So by studying groups of adoptees, researchers can find out whether they're more like their biological parents, or more like their adoptive parents on any particular trait.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: Very smart!  So there's adoption research on alcoholism?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.00" dur="00:00:07.00">RAY: Yes there is. Research has been done in Denmark, in Sweden, and in the United States, and the results are remarkably similar.</p>   
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:14.00">RAY: From this research, we can learn a lot about the nature of risk for alcoholism. Is that risk something that can be changed, like environment, or is the risk something more that cannot be changed, like biology?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:30.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Ok Ray, let's take a closer look at what the research tells us.</p>
