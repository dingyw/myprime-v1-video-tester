	   Ray Daugherty, co-author of Prime for Life, is joining us to share some research that will help us understand why alcoholism runs in families. Hi Ray, thanks for joining us.

	   Hi Antonio.  We’re going to look at adoption research, because it’s one of the best ways to understand why any particular trait runs in families.

	   Adoption research, okay.… so what can that tell us? 
      </p>

	   Quite a bit actually. When you think the typical family, the same parents give us both our biology and our home environment.   So, when we're trying to understand why something “runs in families”—it could be something like a sense of humor, or, alcoholism, it’s really hard to tease that out, since the same parents gave us both home environment and biology.

	   Ok, I think I can see where this is going.  When people are adopted at a young age, the parents who gave birth to them and the parents who raised them are different people…

	   Exactly.  So by studying groups of adoptees, researchers can find out whether they're more like their biological parents, or more like their adoptive parents on any particular trait.

	   Very smart!  So there's adoption research on alcoholism? 
      </p>

        <b>Ray: </b>

	   Yes there is. Research has been done in Denmark, in Sweden, and in the United States, and the results are remarkably similar.   From this research, we can learn a lot about the nature of risk for alcoholism.  Is that risk something that can be changed, like environment, or is the risk more like something that cannot be changed, like biology?

		Ok Ray, let’s take a closer look at what the research tells us.
