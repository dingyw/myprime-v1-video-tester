      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Remember the adoption studies we looked at earlier? It surprises most people to learn that living with a parent who has alcoholism does not increase the risk of alcoholism for the children.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Now, this doesn't mean that  environment isn't important. But it does tell us that environmental influences don't always work the way we think they do.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In fact, living with a parent who has alcoholism often influences children to either abstain or drink very little, because they see effects of heavy drinking firsthand. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: unsurprisingly, living with a heavy drinking parent is mostly likely to influence a child to drink when the child does not see the parent experiencing problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Siblings, peers and society as a whole also influence people's choices about alcohol and drugs. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Generally speaking, while parents have a stronger influence on the choice not to drink or use drugs, peers have a stronger influence on the choice to drink or use drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The research is clear; the more we socialize with people who drink a lot or use drugs, the more likely we are to do the same. Of course, people who don't belong to heavy drinking groups can still develop alcoholism or addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: But when our social group influences us to make high-risk choices, our risk for problems also increases.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Just as groups that accept or encourage high-risk drinking or drug use have higher rates of alcoholism and addiction, Research also suggests that when social factors influence people to make low-risk choices we see lower rates of alcoholism and drug addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In fact, having even one good friend who does not drink or use drugs increases the chance that we will also not use, or use less. So social factors do show a measurable influence on the rates of alcoholism or addiction. </p>
