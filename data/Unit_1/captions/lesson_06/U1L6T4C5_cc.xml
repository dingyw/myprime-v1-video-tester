	   Remember the adoption studies we looked at earlier? It surprises most people to learn that living with a parent who has alcoholism does not increase the risk of alcoholism for the children.  Now, this doesn’t mean that  environment isn’t important. But it does tell us that environmental influences don't always work the way we think they do. 
In fact, living with a parent who has alcoholism often influences children to either abstain or drink very little, because they see effects of heavy drinking firsthand. unsurprisingly, living with a heavy drinking parent is mostly likely to influence a child to drink when the child does not see the parent experiencing problems.
Siblings, peers and society as a whole also influence people's choices about alcohol and drugs. Generally speaking, while parents have a stronger influence on the choice not to drink or use drugs, peers have a stronger influence on the choice to drink or use drugs.
The research is clear; the more we socialize with people who drink a lot or use drugs, the more likely we are to do the same. Of course, people who don’t belong to heavy drinking groups can still develop alcoholism or addiction. But when our social group influences us to make high-risk choices, our risk for problems also increases. 
Just as groups that accept or encourage high-risk drinking or drug use have higher rates of alcoholism and addiction, Research also suggests that when social factors influence people to make low-risk choices we see lower rates of alcoholism and drug addiction.
In fact, having even one good friend who does not drink or use drugs increases the chance that we will also not use, or use less.  So social factors do show a measurable influence on the rates of alcoholism or addiction.
