      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Sometimes we make drinking choices thinking alcohol will always affect us the same way. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Or, we unintentionally make high-risk drinking choices because we believe we should be able to drink the same amount as other people. 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: But in reality, there are biological factors that can cause two people to respond very differently to the same amount of alcohol. Or even cause the same person to respond differently on one day versus another.</p>

      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WAITER: Wine list? I'll be right back with that.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: If we are not aware of these factors, we're more likely to experience an impairment problem. So, we're going to identify them now.</p>
