	   Ray Daugherty is back to help us with further personalizing the recommendations.  So, how do we know if we should adjust our low-risk guidelines?
      </p>

	   It’s all about assessing our biological risk. We can do that with a couple of questions.
The first question is, “Do I have high tolerance?”
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

	   Compared to whom?  My grandma or a 300 pound defensive lineman? Isn’t tolerance relative? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray Daugherty:</b>
        <br/>
	   It is.  And not just about age and body size. Sometimes we’ll find a small woman who has a higher tolerance than the linebacker. We need to start by asking ourselves, “does it take more alcohol for me to become impaired compared to most people.”
And in making this comparison, it’s important to look beyond our own group of friends, because our own friends may drink similarly to us, and may have a similar tolerance. Instead, think about people of my same age, gender, and body size, who are casual drinkers.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Alright, so first we consider our tolerance.  What’s next?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray Daugherty:</b>
        <br/>
	   Next, we look at our family history.   “Do I have a biological parent, grandparent, brother, or sister with alcoholism?”
The more blood relatives I have with alcoholism and the closer they are in the bloodline, the greater my risk for developing alcoholism myself. 
      </p>

        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   What if I don’t know my biological family’s history?  Let’s say I was adopted. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray Daugherty:</b>
        <br/>
	   That’s a great question.   Research indicates that when there’s a family history of alcoholism, we also often see a high initial tolerance to alcohol. So, if we don’t know our family history, we need to look very closely at our tolerance to alcohol--it’s the only risk factor we have to measure.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Got it.  A high tolerance and a family history of alcoholism are the two risk factors.  But, what if I don’t have either of these risk factors? Then, can I drink as much as I want? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray Daugherty:</b>
        <br/>
	   Nice try Antonio--I think you know the answer to that one though!  If we don’t have either of the risk factors then the 0-1-2-3 guidelines would be for us. 
If we have one or two of the risk factors, then we might want to consider whether to make some adjustments to the guidelines. 
      </p>

	   Like what?  Limiting myself to one or two drinks in any given day? 
      </p>

	   Yes, exactly. Or for some people, adjusting all the way to zero, depending on the strength of our risk factors.  Also it’s important to keep in mind that those of us who have already passed our trigger level, our only low-risk choice would be zero.
