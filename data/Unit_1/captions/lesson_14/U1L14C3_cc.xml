	   You’ve probably heard that the human body is mostly fluids, and it’s true. Fluids account for approximately 60 percent of a person’s body mass. And drink for drink, a person with less body fluid may become impaired more easily.
This is because a person with more body fluid will have a lower blood alcohol level after the same number of drinks. 
Three things that influence someone’s total body fluid are body size, gender, and age. 
For “body size,” we’re referring to muscle mass, not fat.  People with a smaller amount of muscle mass might need to drink less than larger individuals to avoid impairment.
Women often become impaired more quickly than men, and the impairment may last longer.  This is true even when we compare men and women of the same weight.  Pound for pound, women typically have less body fluid than men, so there is less to dilute the alcohol.
Age also plays a role.  Adolescents have a smaller body size than adults, and the elderly often have less body fluid. This leads to a higher blood alcohol level, so both groups may become impaired more easily.
Many medications are labeled, “don’t drink alcohol while taking this drug.” And there’s good reason for this warning. Drinking alcohol together with certain medications, such as sleeping pills, antihistamines, aspirin, and prescription drugs can be dangerous. 
For example, if a person has a .06 blood alcohol level and takes a traditional antihistamine, they might experience as much impairment as they would typically feel at a .1 blood alcohol level. This could lead to an impaired driving arrest or worse. 
Some combinations, such as alcohol and a sedative, can be fatal. In other cases, alcohol can render a medication ineffective. It’s important for people taking any type of prescription or over-the-counter drug to check with their doctor or pharmacist before consuming alcohol. 
And because any use of illegal drugs is high-risk for impairment and addiction, clearly using them in combination with alcohol would also be high-risk and increase the likelihood of problems.
A person who is tired, sick, or recovering from an illness may experience greater impairment from alcohol than usual. As you might guess, tiredness increases the risk for car crashes. Shift workers have special risks. Working a late or overnight shift increases drowsiness and interrupts workers’ patterns of sleeping and waking.
This increased risk may also apply to people who operate on very little sleep due to work, studying, taking trips, or partying.
Puberty changes sleep patterns, so adolescents may be drowsy, even if they get enough sleep.  This adds to their risk of impairment.
You’ve probably heard the tip, “don’t drink on an empty stomach.” When food is in the stomach, the valve between it and intestine closes.  This slows but does not stop the rate at which alcohol enters into the blood stream. 
So, a person who drinks on an empty stomach will experience quicker impairment and be at greater risk for an impairment problem. However this does not mean you can’t get impaired if you drink on a full stomach.
