      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">ANTONIO: Obviously, no one wants to have impairment problems. But the fact is, the only way to prevent impairment problems is to prevent impairment.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: And we can do this by making low-risk choices. This will also reduce our risk for health problems like alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Once again, the low-risk guidelines are "0 drugs, 1 drink in an hour, 2 drinks daily, and no more than 3 drinks on any given day."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ONLINE USER 1: So I'm a bigger guy and alcohol doesn't affect me as much. So... can't I drink more and still be low-risk?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ONLINE USER 2: Yeah, we just learned that alcohol effects everyone differently, so why do we all have the same guidelines?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Good questions. We are not implying that you should increase these guidelines.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: These guidelines are low-risk for most people. But it's important to remember one size doesn't fit all. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: If we have increased biological risk we can make adjustments to prevent health problems. And to prevent impairment problems, we may need to make day-to-day adjustments, depending upon our situation. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: If you'd like, take a look at how some other viewers decided to adjust their guidelines. Then you'll have a chance to look at the factors that might affect your choices.</p>
