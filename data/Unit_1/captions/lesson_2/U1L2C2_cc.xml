	The problem with high-risk drug and alcohol choices is that the good times can quickly turn into not-so-good times.
	Here are a few of the problems that people experience. 
	Okay, so that's more than a few…. But all of these problems basically fall into two categories: health problems and impairment problems. 
	High-risk alcohol or drug use can lead to health problems like pancreatitis, liver disease,brain damage, some forms of cancer, and alcoholism or addiction.  Most of these problems develop over months or years of high-risk use.  
	But impairment problems like falls, fights…
	Getting arrested, losing a job, or crashing a car can happen in just one night of high-risk choices. </p>

	All it takes is drinking enough to impair mental,physical, or emotional functioning. 
	Later on, we'll learn who's at risk for both health and impairment problems….
	We'll also learn how to prevent both health and impairment problems.</p>
