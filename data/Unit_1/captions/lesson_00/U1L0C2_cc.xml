      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Hello, and welcome to myPRIME. My name is Antonio Neves, and I'll be your host for the course. Now, you may be wondering what this course is all about. This is Ray Daugherty, the co-author of Prime for Life.  So Ray, I know our learners are curious… what exactly is myPRIME?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: MyPRIME is the independent learning version of Prime for Life. MyPRIME is for anyone. The course makes no assumptions about current or past alcohol or drug use.  If someone has not had a problem with alcohol or drugs, myPRIME can help them avoid problems in the future. If they have had a problem, myPRIME can help them decide how the future might look different from the past.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay. So, you mentioned that myPRIME is “research-based.” What does that mean?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Well that's a good question. The information in myPRIME comes from research, not from anyone's opinion—it's based on what research tells us is true for most people, most of the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Alright, but what do we really need the research for? I mean, most of us have a pretty good idea of what we're supposed to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: I think that's true in a general sense, but we lack a specific sense of what to do.  And it's the specifics that can get us into trouble.  People often have been told what to do as if there's one answer that fits everyone. As we get going in the program, I think many people will find that the research findings are actually surprising.  MyPRIME gives you the research on alcohol and drugs, so you can make informed choices to protect the things you value most in life. YOU decide what it is you value.  And ultimately, YOU decide what to do with the information.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Sounds good.  Is there anything else our viewers should know before we get started?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Yes, I'd like to say a word about confidentiality. The information that you provide in this program is strictly confidential.  Your responses will never be connected to your identity. And the more honest and accurate your responses are, the more beneficial the program can be for you.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: That's good to know. Thanks Ray.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Thanks, Antonio.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Before we begin, here's a presentation on how to use the program, and how to create a login. There's also an optional assessment you can complete.  It gives us more information about our learners, so we can improve the program. Once you've set up your login, we'll begin.</p>
