	   So, If we continually drink to the point of impairment, our physical tolerance goes up quickly, but our mental tolerance creeps up much more slowly.  
So the window where we’re mentally impaired, but not physically impaired gets larger.  And many of us think we’re "good to go" in this window. 
This makes us vulnerable to problems.  We may think it’s safe do things like drive or swim, when it’s not. 
Remember our friends from the barbeque?  Now, we’re going to find out who got the DUI.

	   Good evening sir. I'm Corporal Lowry Queens County Office of the Sheriff. The reason I pulled you over is because you failed to maintain a single lane back there. I just need to see your license and registration if you have it.
Is this your current address on your license, sir?

	   Alright, go ahead and step out of the vehicle for me. We're gonna do some field sobriety testing just to make sure that you're okay to drive.

	   So, why didn’t he realize he was impaired?  
His high tolerance made him less sensitive to the effects of alcohol.  He wasn’t physically impaired so he didn’t realize he was experiencing significant mental impairment.

	   When I first started drinking it didn’t take much to get hammered.  But after a while I just started to handle it, and now I can drink three times what I used to and it has almost no effect.  I felt fine when the cop pulled me over.  I thought there was no way I was over the limit.

	   This type of thinking is pretty common.  He knows his tolerance has gone up, but he still relies on signs of physical impairment to gauge when he’s had too much.
A high tolerance can trick us into thinking we’re fine when we’re really not, because it changes our sensitivity to alcohol or drugs.  
How does that work?  To better understand, we’re going to look at another type of tolerance—tolerance to the taste of sugar.
