      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">ANTONIO: So, If we continually drink to the point of impairment, our physical tolerance goes up quickly, but our mental tolerance creeps up much more slowly. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: So the window where we're mentally impaired, but not physically impaired gets larger. And many of us think we're "good to go" in this window. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: This makes us vulnerable to problems. We may think it's safe do things like drive or swim, when it's not.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: Now, we're going to find out who got the DUI.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:41.00">(Police siren) OFFICER: Good evening sir. I'm Corporal Lowry Queens County Office of the Sheriff.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:12.00">OFFICER: The reason I pulled you over is because you failed to maintain a single lane back there. I just need to see your license and registration if you have it. Is this your current address on your license, sir?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOHN: Yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:26.00" dur="00:00:02.00">OFFICER: Have you had anything to drink tonight?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:04.00">JOHN: Uhhh, yeah, I had maybe a couple beers.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:32.00" dur="00:00:53.00">OFFICER: Couple beers. Alright, go ahead and step out of the vehicle for me. We're gonna do some field sobriety testing just to make sure that you're okay to drive.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: So, why didn't he realize he was impaired? </p> 
      <p begin="00:02:29.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: His high tolerance made him less sensitive to the effects of alcohol. He wasn't physically impaired so he didn't realize he was experiencing significant mental impairment.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.00" dur="00:00:17.00">JOHN: When I first started drinking it didn't take much to get hammered. But after a while I just started to handle it, and now I can drink three times as much as I could before and it has almost no effect.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:57.00" dur="00:00:16.00">JOHN: I felt fine when the cop pulled me over. I thought there was no way I was over the limit.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:13.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: This type of thinking is pretty common. He knows his tolerance has gone up, but he still relies on signs of physical impairment to gauge when he's had too much.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: A high tolerance can trick us into thinking we're fine when we're really not, because it changes our sensitivity to alcohol or drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:33.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: How does that work? To better understand, we're going to look at another type of toleranceâ€”tolerance to the taste of sugar.</p>
