      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: High tolerance can trick us in several ways. First, we rely primarily on signs of physical impairment to tell us when we've have had too much to drink. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Second, risk begins at the point of mental impairment, which occurs before physical impairment. The signs of mental impairment are more difficult to recognize.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Third, the higher our tolerance level, the bigger the gap is between our mental and physical tolerance levels, and the longer it takes us to recognize physical impairment.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: And finally, the higher our tolerance level, the less sensitive we are to the effects of alcohol.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Together, these are a perfect storm; they cause people with a high tolerance to take risks they believe are safe, when they are actually putting themselves at risk. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: How do we know high tolerance increases our risk for impairment problems? One way we can tell is by looking at the average blood alcohol level at arrest.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In multiple countries, the average blood alcohol level among impaired drivers is about a .15.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: But, people who have a low tolerance can't reach a .15 and still drive because they'd be asleep! So, this tells us that most people who are arrested have a high tolerance.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In the united states, midnight on friday and saturday nights is a dangerous time to drive. Nearly 4% of drivers have a blood alcohol level of .10 or higher. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Yet these drivers account for 46% of all the fatal crashes that occur between 12 a.m. And 1 a.m.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Of course most drivers who are pulled over don't believe they are impaired, even when they are. Oftentimes, their high tolerance causes them to be less sensitive to the effects of alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: High tolerance may seem like an asset, but when it comes to avoiding problems, it's really a liability.</p>
