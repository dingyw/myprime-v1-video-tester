	   Okay, here’s another way to think about sensitivity.  
Imagine two people walking barefoot along a rocky beach that is covered with broken shells.
One of them has baby soft feet.  No calluses!  And with the first step, his feet are really hurting—he has a low tolerance for the rocky terrain.
Because he’s sensitive to the pain, he quickly understands the risk, and throws on a pair of shoes. 
The other has callused feet, so he doesn’t feel a thing.  He has a high tolerance for the rough surface, and his feet are less sensitive to the pain.  This makes it easier for him to walk on the rough ground.
His high tolerance makes him think he can walk on whatever he wants, but sharp objects still cut.  If he continues on barefoot, he won’t realize he’s getting cut until it is too late. 
So, of these two people, the one with a higher tolerance for pain is more likely to get hurt.  And they are the one who felt the safest.
