      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">ANTONIO: So, to bring this back to alcohol and drugs... If I have a high tolerance, I may feel like it's protecting me from having problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: But in reality, a high tolerance can make me less sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and lead me to believe I'm not at risk for problems, when I am.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: A person with low tolerance feels the effect and stops. A person with high tolerance does not feel it for a long time and keeps on drinking.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: By the time they realize they are impaired, it is often too late to protect themselves.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ONLINE USER 1: I've always been proud of the fact that I had a high tolerance. I used to brag to everyone that I may be small but I can hold my liquor.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ONLINE USER 2: Well, I have a low tolerance and I'm actually the one who's falling asleep on the couch after a few beers. But, a lot of my friends are able to drink a lot more than me and have a high tolerance.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ONLINE USER 2: It's pretty scary, because they're the ones I'm going to at the end of the night to drive me home.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ONLINE USER 3: Well, you can't change your biology... I've always had a high tolerance.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Yeah, okay... it's understandable we might still believe having a high tolerance helps us, especially if we haven't experienced problems yet.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: But let's take a closer look at the pattern of how a high-tolerance can trick us into believing we're not at risk for impairment problems.</p>
