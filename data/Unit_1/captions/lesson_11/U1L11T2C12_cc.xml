	   So, to bring this back to alcohol and drugs… If I have a high tolerance, I may feel like it’s protecting me from having problems.  But it reality, a high tolerance can make me less sensitive to the effects of alcohol, and lead me to believe I’m not at risk for problems, when I am. 
A person with low tolerance feels the effect and stops. A person with high tolerance does not feel it for a long time and keeps on drinking. By the time they realize they are impaired, it is often too late to protect themselves.

	   I've always been proud of the fact that I had a high tolerance. I used to brag to everyone that I may be small but I can hold my liquor.

	   Well, I have a low tolerance and I'm actually the one who's falling asleep on the couch after a few beers. But, a lot of my friends are able to drink a lot more than me and have a high tolerance. It's pretty scary, cause they're the ones I'm going to at the end of the night to drive me home.

	   Well, you can't change your biology... I've always had a high tolerance.

	   I actually got a D.U.I. at Fort Belvoir just recently. I felt fine, I'd had a few drinks, I'd just come out of Germany, so my tolerance level was pretty high--I spent three years there. I felt fine, mentally, and physically I was acting fine, I left to drive. I got pulled over for doing a California roll at a stop sign--I just kinda slowed down a little bit, looked, then went ahead, but there happened to be a Virginia state police officer down the street who saw me do it. When they pulled me over, they had me do the field sobriety test. I performed fine on all those--no problems. Military policy on Fort Belvoir is that if you get pulled over during those hours, you're gonna get a breathalyzer. They took me to the station, and when I blew a breathalyzer, and I blew a .15, which is almost twice the legal limit, which was a surprise for me as well as some of the officers that were in the room, just because of the way I was acting. So, I got a D.U.I... There's no way getting out of that. It was crazy to blow a level that high but feel normal.

	   Yeah, okay… it’s understandable we might still believe having a high tolerance helps us, especially if we haven’t experienced problems yet.  
But let’s take a closer look at the pattern of how a high-tolerance can trick us into believing we’re not at risk for impairment problems.
