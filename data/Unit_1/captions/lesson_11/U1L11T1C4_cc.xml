      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">ANTONIO: So... wondering who got the DUI? We will find out shortly but first, I want you to think about how you determined who was impaired. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Most of us probably looked for visible signs that someone wasn't 'handling' their alcohol well. But is that a reliable way to tell if someone's impaired? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Let's start by asking a few people to tell us how they know if they've had too much to drink.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:13.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: It's normally a physical impairment, so, maybe the eyes are shuttering... they tend to be stooped over, their balance, their coordination is all of--things like that. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:06.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: I know that I've had too much to drink when I start becoming extremely flirtatious to the guys around me...</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:44.00" dur="00:00:10.00">and it doesn't matter what they look like, who they are, and I start touching and feeling them, not in like a perverted way or anything but I just wanna touch their arms, you know... </p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:18.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Slurring of their words, can't maintain their balance, whether they're sitting or standing... domestic violence... pretty much being outside of your character, than what you normally are when you're sober.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: When I've had way too much to drink I'm stumbling around, I'm saying stupid things, I'm laughing at everything everyone says, even if it's not funny or it's really rude...  </p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.00" dur="00:00:15.00">and I feel different, I can't control my body. Like, I just stumble everywhere and start walking to the bathroom and I'm swaying--it's not a good feeling. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:39.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: These statements may sound familiar. They reflect the way many people determine when they've had too much. And what all of these people are describing are signs of physical impairment.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:51.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: The common signs of physical impairment are easy to spot—the inability to walk or talk, feeling sleepy, passing out, or getting sick.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:59.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: When we're physically impaired it's obvious, and if we manage to avoid these things, we look and feel like we're "handling" it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:08.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Most of us recognized when characters at the party showed these signs, and we were right, those characters were impaired.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:16.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: But, here's the catch: it turns out everyone at the party was impaired... even the guy who appeared to be 'handling' his liquor just fine.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: That's because there are two types of impairment at work—physical impairment and mental impairment. Take a look.</p>
