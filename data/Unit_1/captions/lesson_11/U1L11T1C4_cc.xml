	   So… wondering who got the DUI?  We will find out shortly but first, I want you to think about how you determined who was impaired.  
Most of us probably looked for visible signs that someone wasn’t ‘handling’ their alcohol well.  But is that a reliable way to tell if someone’s impaired?  Let’s start by asking a few people to tell us how they know if they’ve had too much to drink.

	   It's normally a physical impairment, so, maybe the eyes are shuttering... they tend to be stooped over, their balance, their coordination is all of--things like that.

	   I know that I've had too much to drink when I start becoming extremely flirtatious to the guys around me... and it doesn't matter what they look like, who they are, and I start touching and feeling them, not in like a perverted way or anything but I just wanna touch their arms, you know...
      </p>

	   Slurring of their words, can't maintain their balance, whether they're sitting or standing... domestic violence... pretty much being outside of your character, than what you normally are when you're sober.

	   When I've had way too much to drink I'm stumbling around, I'm saying stupid things, I'm laughing at everything everyone says, even if it's not funny or it's really rude... and I feel different, I can't control my body. Like, I just stumble everywhere and start walking to the bathroom and I'm swaying--it's not a good feeling.

	   These statements may sound familiar.  They reflect the way many people determine when they’ve had too much.  And what all of these people are describing are signs of physical impairment. 
The common signs of physical impairment are easy to spot—the inability to walk or talk, feeling sleepy, passing out, or getting sick.  When we’re physically impaired it’s obvious, and if we manage to avoid these things, we look and feel like we’re "handling" it. 
Most of us recognized when characters at the party showed these signs, and we were right, those characters were impaired.  
But, here’s the catch: it turns out everyone at the party was impaired… even the guy who appeared to be ‘handling’ his liquor just fine.
That’s because there are two types of impairment at work—physical impairment and mental impairment.
Take a look.
