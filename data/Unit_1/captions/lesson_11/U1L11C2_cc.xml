      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so we know there are two types of problems high-risk choices can lead to:  health problems and impairment problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Health problems can take months or even years to develop. They don't happen overnight... </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: But impairment problems can occur in just one day or evening of making high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Now, when we use the word impairment in this program, it's not just another word for drunk or high. It means any change in our ability to function—mentally or physically—that increases our risk for problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: If we're in a situation that calls for quick thinking, we don't have to be drunk or high to end up injured or even dead. So obviously being impaired only ups the risk level. Let's take a look at an example of how this can play out. </p>
