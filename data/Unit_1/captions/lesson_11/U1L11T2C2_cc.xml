	   But what if you have a high tolerance?

	   If you have a higher tolerance, than it takes more alcohol to become impaired.

	   Right--like me. I have a higher tolerance, doesn't that mean I should be able to drink more than other people without having a problem?

	   All good questions.  It does seem like people with a high tolerance can drink more than others without having problems.  We’re going to see if that’s true, but first we need a clear understanding of how tolerance works.
