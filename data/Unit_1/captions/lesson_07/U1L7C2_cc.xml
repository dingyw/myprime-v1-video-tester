      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:14.75">ANTONIO: Okay, let's take a step back for a minute. At this point we know it's our biology and high-risk choices that put us at risk for problems, but let's see what questions our Online users have.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:04.50">ONLINE USER 1: So how much can I drink? And how often? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.50" dur="00:00:06.50">ONLINE USER 2: How can we all have the same answer? I mean, if we have different trigger levels, can't be one answer, right?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ONLINE USER 3: But I don't know what my trigger level is. Is there a way to find out? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ONLINE USER 4: When you say low-risk choices, what exactly does that mean? How much is too much? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: These are all good questions. Let's think about them in terms of the formula.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: We know that Biology + Choices = Outcome. But to make this useful to us, we need to get more specific about a couple things.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: The first piece of the puzzle we're missing is, "what is my biological risk?"  Or, more simply, "where is my trigger level?"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: And then, if we want to avoid problems, the second thing we need to know is, what choices are low risk? Or basicallyâ€”how many drinks can I have without increasing my risk? </p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: And we'll get to that, but first... it probably sounds like counting drinks is pretty easy. Well, not so fast!</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: It turns out many people have different ideas of what a drink is, so we're going to need to set some standards here.</p>
