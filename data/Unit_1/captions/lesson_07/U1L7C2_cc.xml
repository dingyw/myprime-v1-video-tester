	   Okay, let’s take a step back for a minute.  At this point we know it’s our biology and high-risk choices that put us at risk for problems, but let’s see what questions our online users have.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 1: </b>
        <br/>
	   So how much can I drink?  And how often? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 2:</b>
        <br/>
	   How can we all have the same answer? I mean, if we have different trigger levels, it can’t be one answer, right?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 3:</b>
        <br/>
	   But I don’t know what my trigger level is.  Is there a way to find out? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 4:</b>
        <br/>
	   When you say low-risk choices, what exactly does that mean? How much is too much?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

	   These are all good questions. Let’s think about them in terms of the formula.
We know that Biology + Choices = Outcome. But to make this useful to us, we need to get more specific about a couple things.
The first piece of the puzzle we’re missing is, “what is my biological risk?”  Or, more simply, “where is my trigger level?”
And then, if we want to avoid problems, the second thing we need to know is, what choices are low risk? Or basically—how many drinks can I have without increasing my risk?  
And we’ll get to that, but first… you probably think counting drinks is pretty easy, don’t you?  Well, not so fast!  It turns out many people have different ideas of what one drink is, so we’re going to need to set some standards here.
