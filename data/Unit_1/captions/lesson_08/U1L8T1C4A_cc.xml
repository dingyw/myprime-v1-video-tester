	  As long as you don't drink alone... you're in no danger of having a problem.

	 People with alcoholism often drink alone, but that doesn't mean you can prevent it by sticking to the buddy system. Drinking alone is an indicator of a problem, not the cause it.. People having a heart attack have chest pains, but no one would say, "You can prevent a heart attack by not having chest pains."

	  Make sure you're not drinking in the morning, because if you do, then you have a major problem.

	Well, that's like saying as long as you drink in the evenings you won't have problems, or end up with alcoholism. People with alcoholism might drink in the morning because they're addicted, but the time of day someone drinks doesn't determine if they'll develop alcoholism.

	  Yeah, I hear that it's okay drink beer, but you should stay away from hard liquor.

Six beers have the same amount of alcohol content as six standard mixed drinks, and both will have the same effect on the body. And actually, some studies have shown beer to be the beverage of choice for most people with alcoholism.

	  I heard that a way to sober up really quick is to take a really cold shower.

        RAY:
        
	This is similar to the "drink coffee" advice. An impaired person might "feel" more alert after a cold shower, but they're still impaired. It doesn't help metabolize the alcohol, minimize impairment, or speed up recovery from a hangover.

	 People always say, "friends don't let friends drive drunk."

        RAY:
        
	Great, but what about other impairment or health problems like liver disease or just falling down? It's true you can't crash a car without driving it, but that still leaves a lot of other potential problems. Maybe we should say, "Friends encourage friends not to get drunk."
