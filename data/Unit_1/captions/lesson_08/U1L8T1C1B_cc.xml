	   So once again, Ray Daugherty of PRI is with us. Thanks Ray.
      </p>

        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   Glad to be here.
      </p>

        <b>Antonio:</b>

	   Okay. So, If we want to prevent health and impairment problems there’s no shortage of advice out there, but is it practical?  We’ve all probably heard, “Just don’t drink!” 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, and that one always works, doesn't it? It's like we have to drink in order to develop problems with alcohol.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   But don’t most people drink? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   Absolutely. In the United States, about 2/3 of adults drink.  And the advice that they hear is generally things like, "well, if you're going to drink, just drink moderately."
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Okay, so, what is "moderate?"
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   That's the problem, isn't it?  Another one you hear is, ‘drink responsibly,’ or it’s okay to drink ‘socially.’
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Ray, none of this advice seems very helpful.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   That's right, it's not very useful. It's ill-defined and people can read into it anything that they want to. It does not tell us how to prevent problems.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Okay, I’d like to get your take on some other bits of drinking advice. 
We recently took to the streets, and we asked people what they think about how to prevent problems with alcohol.  Here are a few of their responses… 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Person on the street:</b>
        <br/>
	   I think it boils down to knowing your limit... If you stick to one thing, and pace yourself, know when to cut yourself off.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Well, I’ve certainly heard that one before.  It’s not very specific, is it? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   No, and it doesn’t work because there's no way to know we've hit our limit 'til we have a problem.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Right, it’s like saying “You’ll know you’ve had too much cholesterol when you have a heart attack!”  Not very helpful!  Here’s another one…
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Person on the street:</b>
        <br/>
	   The key limit, is, essentially, you're allowed to have one shot, or one glass of wine, or one beer an hour. And you have to pace yourselves. It's your own concentration.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray:</b>
        <br/>
	   This one does substantially reduce impairment, in fact for some people, it might prevent it all together.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   So, there’s some truth to it? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   Some, but where it falls short is in not giving us guidance about how much we can consume in a day. It's like there’s no upper limit.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, it makes it seem like a person could have 24 drinks a day.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray: </b>
        <br/>
	   Right, which is why—by itself—it’s not helpful advice. A person could follow it exactly and still end up with serious problems.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Okay, here's the next one…
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Person on the street:</b>
        <br/>
	   Coffee has antioxidants in it, that brings down the alcohol level in your blood, and of course brings down your high.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Does coffee help you at all?  It seems like it does…
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray:</b>
        <br/>
	   Well it seems like it does, because the caffiene in the coffe makes people feel more alert, but it does not take away the impairment.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   That sounds risky, because people could think they’re more sober than they actually are. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ray:</b>
        <br/>
	   Exactly, so they're willing to take more risks.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   We also asked our online users to submit drinking advice they’ve heard.  Next you’ll have the option to view them, along with Ray’s response to each piece of advice.
