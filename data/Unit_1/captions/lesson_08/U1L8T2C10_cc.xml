        NARRATOR:
        
	   Mixed drinks vary according to the recipe and how accurately the alcohol is measured but most have at least one and a half standard drinks. Martinis can add upâ€”they typically start out with almost two standard drinks in them. According to one bartender's guide, a regular martini has three standard drinks in it. Long Island Iced Tea has four standard drinks. 
Again, different types of alcohol have different percentages. Liquor can run anywhere from 40 to 95 percent alcohol.
