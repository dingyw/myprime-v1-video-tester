	   So, as you can see, most of the advice we hear about drinking doesn’t tell us how to prevent problems. 
What if the American Heart Association had said, “exercise moderately,” rather than giving us specific guidelines? 
Remember the health nut? He thinks two hours a day on his bike is moderate.
But our friend over on the couch thinks she is exercising moderately, every time she reaches for the remote.
Or, if the guidelines said, “eat moderately,” people might just assume what they normally eat is “moderate.”  Even if it looked like that…
Just like in these scenarios, when it comes to alcohol, we’ve been left to define terms like “moderate” for ourselves.   So, if most of my friends put away ten drinks in an evening; I might believe drinking six or seven beers is “moderate.”  
We really haven’t been given specific guidelines that can help us prevent problems with alcohol and drugs.  This program will provide clear quantity and frequency guidelines you can use.
