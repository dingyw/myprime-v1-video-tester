      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:06.75">ANTONIO: So, as you can see, most of the advice we hear about drinking doesn't tell us how to prevent problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: What if the American Heart Association had said, "exercise moderately," rather than giving us specific guidelines?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Remember the health nut? He thinks two hours a day on his bike is moderate.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: But our friend over on the couch thinks she is exercising moderately, every time she reaches for the remote.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Or, if the guidelines said, "eat moderately," people might just assume what they normally eat is "moderate."  Even if it looked like that...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Just like in these scenarios, when it comes to alcohol, we've been left to define terms like "moderate" for ourselves.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:45.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: So, if most of my friends put away ten drinks in an evening; I might believe drinking six or seven beers is "moderate." </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: We really haven't been given specific guidelines that can help us prevent problems with alcohol and drugs. This program will provide clear quantity and frequency guidelines you can use.</p>
