      <p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: This is similar to the "drink coffee" advice. An impaired person might "feel" more alert after a cold shower, but they're still impaired. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: It doesn't help metabolize the alcohol, minimize impairment, or speed up recovery from a hangover.</p>
