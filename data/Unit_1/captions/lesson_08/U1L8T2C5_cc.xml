      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">NARRATOR: Look at these different wine glasses. Each of them has exactly five ounces of wine in them. It doesn't look like much, does it?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: A standard drink is often much less than we think. The same glasses filled to a typical level would contain anywhere from one to three standard drinks. There's also a lot of variation in beer containers.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:15.00">NARRATOR: The first glass holds one standard drink... 12 ounces. But the second and third ones hold 16 ounces, and the fourth mug holds 32 ounces of beer. That's 2 Â½ standard drinks!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: And remember that different types of alcohol have different percentages. Beer is usually around 4 to 7 percent. Wine can vary from 8 to 12 percent alcohol.</p>
