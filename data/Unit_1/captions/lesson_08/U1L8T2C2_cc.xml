      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:12.75">ANTONIO: In order to talk about quantity, or how many drinks, we first need to start by defining a standard drink. So, I'm here with Chrisdine King, a fine dining bartender and expert on drink measurement.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: So, most people typically define a drink by using serving containers, like a bottle or a glass. Do you think that is a good way to measure drinks?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:04.00">CHRISDINE: No, because for example, these are both martini glasses.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: That one's almost double! So, glass size can really vary. I can see you stock different size wine glasses, too.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:04.00">CHRISDINE: Well, we carry so many different sizes that glassware's not a good way to measure your drinks.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: So, what about bottle size?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:08.00">CHRISDINE: Good question. Now, most beers are 12 ounces, but not all of them. Check out the differences between these two.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: That's a considerable difference.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:11.00">CHRISDINE: Yeah, and alcoholic beverages also vary in the percent of pure alcohol content. So you might think beer is beer, but this Belgian Ale is almost twice as strong as this pilsner.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: So, we need a standard measure that will apply to different kinds of alcoholic beverages, regardless of their alcohol content or how they're served.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:06.00">CHRISDINE: Well there is something called a standard drink. It is defined as .6 ounce of pure alcohol. That is a little more than half an ounce.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Six tenths of an ounce of pure alcohol. Okay. That's hard to wrap your head around because no beverages are pure alcohol. Can you pour me some examples?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:15.00">CHRISDINE: Sure. Now, the average beer, not an extra strong brew, is about 5% alcohol. So this 12-ounce bottle is about .6 ounce of pure alcohol. As well as this 5-ounce glass of wine.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: I know a few people who pour more generously than that.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.00" dur="00:00:03.00">CHRISDINE: So do I, but, this is one standard drink.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: What about liquor?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:47.00" dur="00:00:09.00">CHRISDINE: Well, the strength of distilled spirits is called proof. And, proof is two times the alcohol content; so this 80 proof spirit is 40% alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:56.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: So, that would mean 1 ½ ounces of 80 proof liquor would contain .6 ounce of pure alcohol, or one standard drink.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.00" dur="00:00:02.00">CHRISDINE: Yup, that's right.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:06.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And that can really add up when it comes to mixed drinks, or martinis.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:09.00" dur="00:00:11.00">CHRISDINE: Tell you what, lets take a look at that martini glass again. This is a one standard drink (pours 1 ¼ ounce shot into martini glass). And this what it looks like in the glass.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:20.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: Wow, that's it?</p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.00" dur="00:00:06.00">CHRISDINE: That's it. But if someone ordered a martini, and I sent out a drink looking like that, chances are it's gonna come back. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: I think you're right. So, your typical martini has more than one standard drink.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:32.00" dur="00:00:03.00">CHRISDINE: Yes, they're usually at least 2 standard drinks, sometimes more.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: That's something a lot of people might not have known. Thanks Chrisdine, this has been really helpful.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:40.00" dur="00:00:01.00">CHRISDINE: Any time.</p>
