	   Thanks for your help.  Counting standard drinks is a consistent way to measure how much you’ve had.  It makes a lot more sense than counting the number of glasses.

	   Definitely.  If you just measure by container you really won’t get a sense of how much alcohol you are consuming. It depends on what you’re drinking and who’s pouring.

	   That makes sense.  This is all great information—now when we talk about how many drinks is “low risk,” we’ll know what one drink really is.
