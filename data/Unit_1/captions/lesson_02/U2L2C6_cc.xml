	   Let's see how that same game-watch might have played out if one of the guys was in the Yellow Phase.
People in the Yellow Phase begin to really enjoy high-risk choices, and feeling shifts from “take-it-or-leave-it” to “anticipation.”

	   Hey Miguel! There's some food over there, and there's a beer in the fridge.

        <b>Narrator:</b>
        <br/>
	   When a person in the Yellow Phase gets together to watch a game, or hang out with friends, they look forward to the drinking or drugs about as much as they look forward to the event. 
It's now an important part of their social life, and doing these things without the alcohol or drugs doesn't see like as much fun because drinking isn't just a part of a good time, it's the way to a good time.
In the Yellow Phase, alcohol and drugs are often a central part of a person's social life and relationships. They believe it makes fun possible. This attitude makes drinking or drug use more important to them, so they are more likely to drink or use more.
