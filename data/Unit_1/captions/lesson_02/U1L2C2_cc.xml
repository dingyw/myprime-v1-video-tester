      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">ANTONIO: The problem with high-risk drug and alcohol choices is that the good times can quickly turn into the not-so-good times.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: Here are a few of the problems that people experience. (Problems appear) Okay, so that's more than a few... </p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: But all of these problems basically fall into two categories: health problems and impairment problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: High-risk alcohol or drug use can lead to health problems like pancreatitis, liver disease, brain damage, some forms of cancer, and alcoholism or addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Most of these problems develop over months or years of high-risk use. But impairment problems like falls, fights... </p>

      <p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: All it takes is drinking enough to impair mental, physical, or emotional functioning.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:06.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Later on, we'll learn who's at risk for both health and impairment problems... </p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:02.50">GUY 1: Yo... You spilled my beer!</p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:02.50">GUY 2: Yeah! I think your mom spilled your beer!</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.00" dur="00:00:02.00">GUY 1: Oh yeah?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:02.00">GUY 2: Yeah!</p>
      <p begin="00:01:17.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: We'll also learn how to prevent both health and impairment problems.</p>
