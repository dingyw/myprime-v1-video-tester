	   Now we'll review the Yellow Phase, which is characterized by making high-risk choices. 
When people in the Yellow Phase drink, they typically drink in high-risk amounts. And since abstinence is the only low-risk choice for all illegal drugs, any drug use to get high, including the use of medications, would place someone at least in the Yellow Phase. 
People in the Yellow Phase may look forward to drinking or using drugs with anticipation.  They may make high-risk choices because they want to get high or intoxicated. Repeated high-risk choices will cause their tolerance level to increase. 
And if they're in a group that has social dependence, high-risk choices can seem normal because everyone in the group is making them.  
They also may experience muddy thinking, and a variety of health and impairment problems.
