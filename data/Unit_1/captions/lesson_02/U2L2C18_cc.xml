	   If we're in the Yellow Phase, we can return to the Green Phase by making low-risk choices. 
However, If we continue to make high-risk choices we are likely to progress to the Orange Phase. The combination of social dependence, changes in the brain, and our increasing anticipation work together to encourage us to continue, and possibly to increase, our drinking or drug use.
How long people stay in the Yellow Phase varies. The change from the Yellow Phase to the Orange Phase is gradual, so it's hard to identify a specific time when the transition occurs.
