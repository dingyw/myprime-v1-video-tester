	   Another outcome of high-risk drinking or drug use is “muddy thinking,” even when a person is sober.
Regular high-risk choices can make it harder to recall a word, figure out a puzzle, or complete mental tasks like math problems.

	   No, you guys go without me.  
How is it I’ve been grading since 2, and this stack hasn’t gotten any smaller?

	   Yeah—for Advanced Algebra.  I’ve been teaching from the same textbook for years, but it seems like it's getting harder.

	   If a person makes high-risk choices regularly, they may experience “muddy thinking,” even when they aren’t drinking or hung-over.  
It many cases, it happens so slowly they don’t even realize it; but high-risk drug or alcohol choices can actually change the brain, making it harder to think clearly.
