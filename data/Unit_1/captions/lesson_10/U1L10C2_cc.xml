	   Those are good questions.  This program is about preventing problems with both drugs and alcohol, but the 1,2,3 guidelines only apply to alcohol.   So, what is low-risk for drugs? Allan Barger, an expert on drugs and the brain, is going to answer that question for us.

	   People who like using drugs may wish there was an amount they could use without increasing their risk for problems.  But the only low-risk choice for drug use that we can identify through research is abstinence. 
We know that people have different trigger levels for problems like heart disease or alcoholism.  But when it comes to drugs, the trigger level is different for each substance.  
On top of that, the strength and purity of a “dose” of illegal drugs isn’t predictable, so people can’t be sure how much—or what—they’re getting.
And finally, the “standard dose” of illicit drugs is generally enough to cause impairment.  So, “zero” is the only low-risk choice when it comes to drugs.
