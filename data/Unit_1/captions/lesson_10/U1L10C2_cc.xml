      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: I don't really drink much, so what's low-risk for pot?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Those are good questions. This program is about preventing problems with both drugs and alcohol, but the 1,2,3 guidelines only apply to alcohol.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, what is low-risk for drugs? Allan Barger, an expert on drugs and the brain, is going to answer that question for us.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: People who like using drugs may wish there was an amount they could use without increasing their risk for problems. But the only low-risk choice for drug use that we can identify through research is abstinence.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: We know that people have different trigger levels for problems like heart disease or alcoholism. But when it comes to drugs, the trigger level is different for each substance.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: On top of that, the strength and purity of a "dose" of illegal drugs isn't predictable, so people can't be sure how much—or what—they're getting.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: And finally, the "standard dose" of illicit drugs is generally enough to cause impairment. So, "zero" is the only low-risk choice when it comes to drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Here's more information about drugs for you to explore if you're interested.</p>
