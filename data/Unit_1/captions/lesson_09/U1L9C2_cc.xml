	   Researchers from around the world have published over 200 scientific studies that can help us determine how many standard drinks would be low risk. 
Now there’s no way we could go over all of them— and I have a hunch you wouldn’t want us to—so we’re gonna make this simple.  
In this lesson we’ll summarize all the research.  You’ll learn the quantities and frequencies of drinking that create risk for both health problems and impairment problems. 
We’ve talked about health problem, but impairment problems will be covered later in the program.  So for now, think of impairment problems as any problem that can happen as a result of just one time drinking or using drugs.
