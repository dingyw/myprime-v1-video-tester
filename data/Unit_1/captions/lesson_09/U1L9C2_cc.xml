      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">ANTONIO: Researchers from around the world have published over 200 scientific studies that can help us determine how many standard drinks would be low risk. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Now there's no way we could go over all of them— and I have a hunch you wouldn't want us to—so we're going to make this simple. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: In this lesson we'll summarize all the research. You'll learn the quantities and frequencies of drinking that create risk for both health problems and impairment problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: We've talked about health problem, but impairment problems will be covered later in the program.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: So for now, think of impairment problems as any problem that can happen as a result of just one time drinking or using drugs.</p>
