	   Let’s look at what research tells us when Pat drinks more than three drinks in any one day.
Research shows that people who have more than three drinks in any one single day are more likely to experience an alcohol-related impairment or health problem.  
Even people who generally drink zero to two drinks a day, but sometimes have more than three in one day, have a higher rate of health problems.
Many people who make high-risk choices don’t die from alcohol-related causes, but those that do die an average of about 30 years sooner than normal. 
About two-thirds of the lost years of life are due to impairment. The rest of the lost years are due to health problems.
In general, the higher the quantity and frequency above two per day, the greater the risk for problems, and the shorter the lifespan.
