      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">NARRATOR: Let's look at what research tells us when Pat drinks more than three drinks on any one day.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: Research shows that people who have more than three drinks on any one single day are more likely to experience an alcohol-related impairment or health problem. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Even people who generally drink zero to two drinks a day, but sometimes have more than three in one day, have a higher rate of health problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Many people who make high-risk choices don't die from alcohol-related causes, but those that do die an average of about 30 years sooner than normal. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: About two-thirds of the lost years of life are due to impairment. The rest of the lost years are due to health problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: In general, the higher the quantity and frequency above two per day, the greater the risk for problems, and the shorter the lifespan.</p>
