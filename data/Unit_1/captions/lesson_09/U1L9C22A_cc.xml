I think it's easy to perceive that everyone around you is doing something if you WANT to do it or expect that itâ€™s a normal thing, but the amount of high risk drinkers in the amount of any given population is probably less than I had imagined when I was drinking, and I think that's a common mistake to think everyone's doing it and it's normal for me because everyone else is doing it too, but it's never as much as people imagine.
