      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:20.00">but I think that the level of high risk... the amount of high risk drinkers in any given population is probably less than I had imagined when I was drinking,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:26.00">and I think that's a common mistake to think that everyone's doing it and it's normal for me to do it because everyone else is doing it too, but I think that it's never as much as people really imagine.</p>
