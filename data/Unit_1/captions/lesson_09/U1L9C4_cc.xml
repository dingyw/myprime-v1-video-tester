      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">ANTONIO: So, we've got all this research. Fortunately, we have Ray Daugherty of PRI with us to help us make sense of it all. Ray?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:13.00">RAY: Hi Antonio. What we're going to do is take all this research we've been looking at, and use it to build low-risk guidelines. They are amounts that we can drink that are not likely to increase our risk for problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: What are the amounts? How much and how often can I drink without increasing my risk for problems?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:13.00">RAY: That's the question, isn't it. So let's start with the most basic time unit, and that is an hour. Research indicates that if we have more than one drink in an hour, we increase our risk for impairment problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: So, the guidelines would call for no more than one in an hour. But if we stopped there, it would be pretty misleading. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: As you indicated earlier, that would make it sound like that we could have 24 drinks in a day, as long as we spaced them an hour apart. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: But that much would clearly be high risk.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:57.00" dur="00:00:14.00">RAY: Yes it would. So, now let's think about daily drinking. For those of us who drink daily, or most days, research tells us that the most that would be low-risk would be two drinks, daily. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: But, in the United States, most of us don't drink every day. So we need to think about "peak drinking" or the most in any day. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: So what does the research tell us?   </p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RAY: Research tells us that if we have more than 3 drinks in any one day, we increase our risk for both health and impairment problems. So the most we could have in any day that would still be low-risk is 3.  </p>
      <p begin="00:01:34.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: So it's easy as 1-2-3. No more than 1 drink an hour, 2 daily, and 3 on any given day.  </p>
      <p begin="00:01:41.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: You've got it. And it's important to keep in mind too, that zero is always a low-risk choice for anybody, and the only low-risk choice for people with alcoholism. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:49.00" dur="00:00:04.00">RAY: So in our case, we could say that it's as easy as "0-1-2-3."   </p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: So, the most drinks someone could have in a week within these guidelines is 14, or an average of 2 daily.  </p>
      <p begin="00:01:59.00" dur="00:00:04.00">RAY: That's right, but of course they can't all be consumed in one or two days. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:03.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: Like on a Friday or a Saturday night?  </p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: Right, that's the most common pattern, but of course it doesn't matter what day of week it is-- anytime we drink more than three in a day, we've increased our risk. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: So, we can't really save these up for the weekend or any other time during the week. More than three in a day, we've increased our risk for problems--it's high-risk. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:22.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: These guidelines are prevention guidelines. They're intended for people who do not have alcoholism.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:28.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: What about people who do have alcoholism? </p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: For those who do have alcoholism, the only low-risk choice would be zero. They've already passed their trigger level, so it's too late for prevention. What they need is recovery guidelines. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.00" dur="00:00:02.00">RAY: Recovery guidelines would be abstinence. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:43.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: Okay, thanks Ray. There are many combinations of drinks that fit within the 0-1-2-3 guidelines, and many more that would not. The next activity will allow you to figure out how it all adds up. </p>
