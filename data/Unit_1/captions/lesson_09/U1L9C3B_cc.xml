        NARRATOR:
        
	   Let's say Pat doesn't drink alcohol at all. When Pat goes out to spend time with his friends, Pat usually orders water or soda.
People who abstain have no alcohol-related problems, or at least none due to their own use of alcohol. The average person who abstains lives longer than people who consume three or more drinks per day.
