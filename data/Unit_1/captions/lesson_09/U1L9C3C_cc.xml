      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:05.75">NARRATOR: Suppose Pat drinks on occasion, and when he does, it's typically between one and two drinks a day. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Overall, research indicates that one or two drinks per day does not increase risk for most people. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: Many studies show that people who on average drink between one and two per day may live longer than either abstainers or those drinking three or more. </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:04.00">NARRATOR: This seems to be due primarily to a reduction in risk for coronary heart disease. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: However, the small decrease in mortality at this level isn't so great that any happy abstainer should start drinking for health benefits.   </p>
