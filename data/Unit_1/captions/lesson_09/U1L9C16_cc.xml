	   If 70% of people who drink are drinking 10% of the alcohol, that means the other 30% are drinking 90% of all the alcohol consumed.
In other words, a small percentage of drinkers are drinking significantly larger quantities than most of the other people who drink.
How do we know this is true?
If everyone was drinking the same amount, then 90% of the alcohol would be consumed by 90% of the drinkers.
But as you can see, because some people make high-risk choices and drink a lot more than others, it takes only 30% of drinkers to consume 90% of all the alcohol in the U.S!
And the fact that it takes 70% of drinkers to drink 10% of the alcohol tells us that most people are making low-risk choices most of the time.
