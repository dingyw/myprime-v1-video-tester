      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">NARRATOR: If 70% of people who drink are drinking 10% of the alcohol, that means the other 30% are drinking 90% of all the alcohol consumed.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: In other words, a small percentage of drinkers are drinking significantly larger quantities than most of the other people who drink. How do we know this is true?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: If everyone was drinking the same amount, then 90% of the alcohol would be consumed by 90% of the drinkers.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: But as you can see, because some people make high-risk choices and drink a lot more than others, it takes only 30% of drinkers to consume 90% of all the alcohol in the U.S!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: And the fact that it takes 70% of drinkers to drink 10% of the alcohol tells us that most people are making low-risk choices most of the time.</p>
