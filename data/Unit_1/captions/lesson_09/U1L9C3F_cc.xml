        <br/>
	   Suppose, every once in a while, Pat likes to go to Happy Hour and drink as much as possible. Sometimes this means tossing down 3 or 4 drinks in an hour.
The amount a person drinks in a one-hour period has an impact on risk. 
Having more than one drink per  hour increases risk for injuries and other impairment problems.
