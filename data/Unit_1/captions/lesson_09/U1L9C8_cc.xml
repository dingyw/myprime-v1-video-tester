	   Okay, so you’ve got the low-risk guidelines?

	   I think so. Low-risk for alcohol means following the 0-1-2-3 guidelines…. One in an hour, two drinks daily, and no more than three on any one day.

	   That's exactly right. Of course, that adds up to no more than 14 in a week, provided that we follow the no more than one in any hour and no more than three in any day part of the guidelines. Anytime we go above these amounts, we have increased our risk for problems, so it's a high-risk choice.
Of course, even if we keep our drinking in this range, it's not an absolute guarantee that we won't experience problems. Some people do. But research tells us that by far, most people who keep their drinking within the low-risk range do not experience problems with alcohol.

	   And zero is always a low-risk choice as well.

	   Yes, and in fact for all of us, there's times and places where zero may be the only low-risk choice, or the only low-risk choice consistent with the law or policies.
