      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:01.75">RAY: So you've got the low-risk guidelines? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:02.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: I think so. Low-risk for alcohol means following the 0-1-2-3 guidelines.... One in an hour, two drinks daily, and no more than three on any one day. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RAY: That's exactly right. Of course, that adds up to no more than 14 in a week, provided that we follow the no more than one in any hour and no more than three in any day part of the guidelines. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:05.00">RAY: Anytime we go above these amounts, we have increased our risk for problems, so it's a high-risk choice.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: Now of course, even if we keep our drinking in this range, it's not an absolute guarantee that we won't experience problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: Some people do. But research tells us that by far, most people who keep their drinking within the low-risk range do not experience problems with alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And zero is always a low-risk choice as well. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RAY: Yes, and in fact for all of us, there's times and places where zero may be the only low-risk choice, or the only low-risk choice consistent with the law or policies.</p>
