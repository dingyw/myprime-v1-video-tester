	   Now those are some interesting questions and concerns. I can see how the 0-1-2-3 guidelines could seem pretty limiting. Ray, are those responses typical?

	   They really are. When people first hear the guidelines, they often feel like they're very limiting, or maybe even unrealistic... especially if they're a lot less than I've been drinking, or that my friends drink, or than I want to drink. In that case, I might want to believe that I can drink a lot more and it still be low-risk

	   That makes sense.

	   Yeah I think it really does. On the other side of this, people who don’t drink at all sometimes when they hear the guidelines they think, "wow, that's a lot," because they may have been accustomed to thinking that any amount is high-risk.
But we don't base the guidelines on people's preferences, their wishes, or even their beliefs. We base the guidelines on research. 
And in that sense, they're very realistic because they represent reality. Now another way that the guidelines are realistic is that this is the way most people in the United States who drink drink most of the time.

	   That seems pretty hard to believe. Let’s take a look at the research about how much alcohol people drink in the United States.
