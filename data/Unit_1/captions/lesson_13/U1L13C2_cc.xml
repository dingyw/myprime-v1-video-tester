	   Okay, so by this point, we know low-risk choices are the key to preventing impairment problems. Now some of us might look for other ways to avoid problems. 
Michelle Ellison from the Prevention Research Institute is back with us to discuss this.  Michelle, what do you think?  Is there a way to make high-risk choices once in a while and stay clear of problems?

	   Well Antonio, high-risk is high-risk.  And believing there are “loopholes,” or ways around that, can actually increase our risk for problems.
