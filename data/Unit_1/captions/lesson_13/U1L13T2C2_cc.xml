      <p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: What do you mean by that? Like, believing I just need to drive really carefully if I've been drinking?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:06.00">MICHELLE: Yeah, and that kind of thinking can be really misleading. It leads us to believe we can do things safely when we can't.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:07.00">MICHELLE: People pulled over for driving under the influence are often surprised to find that their extra effort can't compensate for impairment.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: But, the fact they were pulled over shows they were wrong. Let's break down why "extra effort" can't overcome impairment.</p>
