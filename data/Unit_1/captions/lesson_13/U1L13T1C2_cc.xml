	   Some people believe we can manage the risk by just using a designated driver. 
      </p>

	   I’ve always heard that designated drivers save lives.  How could that increase the risk for impairment problems?  
      </p>

        <b>Michelle:</b>

	   Well, it’s definitely less risky than drinking and driving.
But think with me for a minute. If we use a designated driver tonight, are we likely to drink more or less? 
      </p>

	   Well, I know what I think… let’s see what our users online have to say.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 1:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, of course, I'd drink more.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 2:</b>
        <br/>
	   Whoa, buddy, calm down, they're not asking about you. The question is about people in general.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 3:</b>
        <br/>
	   Well, okay, I think everyone including myself would drink a lot more if you have a designated driver.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Online user 4:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah I agree--when you're not driving, you have to make it count.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Not a lot of debate there.  It seems like people would drink more with a designated driver. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Right, and it doesn’t just seem like it; research back it up.  In a 12-year study in a time where designated driver programs were intensely promoted, drinking days per week went down, but the amount consumed went up by more than 50%.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   That’s pretty significant.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   Yeah, by fixing one problem they actually caused another.  During this period, drinking and driving death rates went down but the amount of highly intoxicated people went up.  Way up.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   I can’t imagine that’s a good thing.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Michelle:</b>
        <br/>
	   You’re absolutely right.  As you can imagine problems from all sorts of other drinking related impairment problems significantly increased.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   That’s interesting. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers…
