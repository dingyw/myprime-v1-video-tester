      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:03.75">MICHELLE: Some people believe we can manage the risk by just using a designated driver. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: I've always heard that designated drivers save lives. How could that increase the risk for impairment problems? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MICHELLE: Well, it's definitely less risky than drinking and driving. But think with me for a minute. If we use a designated driver tonight, are we likely to drink more or less?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: Well, I know what I think... let's see what our users online have to say. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ONLINE USER 1: Yeah, of course, I mean, I'd drink more. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ONLINE USER 2: Whoa, buddy, calm down, they're not asking about you. The question is about people in general.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ONLINE USER 3: Okay, I mean I think everyone including myself would drink a lot more if you have a designated driver.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ONLINE USER 4: Yeah I agree--when you're not driving, you have to make it count.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Not a lot of debate there. It seems like people would drink more with a designated driver.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:12.00">MICHELLE: Right, and it doesn't just seem like it; research backs it up. In a 12-year study in a time where designated driver programs were intensely promoted, drinking days per week went down, but the amount consumed went up by more than 50%. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: That's pretty significant. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MICHELLE: Yeah, by fixing one problem they actually caused another. During this period, drinking and driving death rates went down but the amount of highly intoxicated people went up. Way up. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:09.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: I can't imagine that's a good thing. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.00" dur="00:00:04.00">MICHELLE: You're right. And other types of alcohol related problems significantly increased. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: That's interesting. Let's take a closer look at the numbers...</p>
