      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: Some people believe we can manage the risk by just using a designated driver. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: I've always heard that designated drivers save lives. How could that increase the risk for impairment problems? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: Well, it's definitely less risky than drinking and driving. But think with me for a minute. If we use a designated driver tonight, are we likely to drink more or less?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Well, I know what I think... let's see what our users online have to say. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 1: Yeah, of course, I'd drink more. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: Whoa, buddy, calm down, they're not asking about you. The question is about people in general.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 3: Well, okay, I think everyone including myself would drink a lot more if you have a designated driver.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: Yeah I agree--when you're not driving, you have to make it count.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Not a lot of debate there. It seems like people would drink more with a designated driver.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: Right, and it doesn't just seem like it; research back it up. In a 12-year study in a time where designated driver programs were intensely promoted, drinking days per week went down, but the amount consumed went up by more than 50%. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: That's pretty significant. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: Yeah, by fixing one problem they actually caused another. During this period, drinking and driving death rates went down but the amount of highly intoxicated people went up. Way up. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: I can't imagine that's a good thing. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: You're absolutely right. As you can imagine problems from all sorts of other drinking related impairment problems significantly increased. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: That's interesting. Let's take a closer look at the numbers...</p>
