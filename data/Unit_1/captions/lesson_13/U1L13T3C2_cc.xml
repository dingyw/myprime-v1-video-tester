	   So, what about drugs and impairment?  There are a lot of people who wouldn’t ever drive drunk, but don’t think twice about driving under the influence of drugs.

	   I believed that it was acceptable for me to drive while high on marijuana, because it wasn't the same as alcohol. That was my conception about it--that, you know, I know what it's like to feel drunk, I know what it's like to feel high, they're two different feelings. If I can drive drunk, I surely can drive high.

	   Now, we’ll take a look at what research says about driving under the influence of drugs. When people hear the phrase, “Driving under the influence,” they usually think of alcohol. But, really it can refer to any substance that causes impairment. This includes drugs that people use to get high, and medications that aren’t used to get high. 
And just as with alcohol, people driving under the influence of drugs are less likely to wear a seatbelt, or a helmet if they’re riding a motorcycle, which further increases their risk for injuries and even fatalities. 
Researchers have examined the risks associated with driving while under the influence of specific drugs.  Click on the ones you’d like to learn more about.
