      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ALLAN: Even if the lable on the bottle warns us not to drive or operate machinery while taking the medication we may not take it seriously.
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ALLAN: Even though we might have driven while taking medication without problems in the past that doesn't mean the risk isn't higher.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ALLAN: For example research tells us that people taking anti-anxiety medication like valium or xanax have double the odds of causing a crash compaired to alcohol and drug-free drivers.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ALLAN: Research also shows that mixing alcohol with certain prescription drugs such as valium, darvan, or codine increases risk for imapairment problems such as DUI arrests, crashes, injuries, and death.</p>
