        <br/>
	   During the same 12-year period when designated driver programs were promoted, the percentage of young adult males reporting a memory blackout increased from 22% to 40%. 
The number who missed school or work due to drinking went from 15% to 25%.  
And those who experienced shaking the morning after drinking increased from 9% to 17%. 
Research indicates that while alcohol-related traffic deaths declined during this period, other alcohol-related deaths increased by 8%.
This tells us that while using a designated driver does reduce drinking and driving problems it also significantly increase our risk for other impairment problems.
