	   So, the reality is, anyone who makes high-risk choices can have impairment problems?

	   Right, high-risk choices up the risk for impairment problems--and research backs this up. We can’t avoid problems by using a designated driver or compensating with "extra effort." 
There’s only one way to prevent impairment problems. It’s simple, but it’s not always easy; To prevent impairment problems, we have to prevent impairment.

	   Thanks, Michelle. Remember how we talked about keeping our eye on the ball?  Well, we can prevent impairment and future problems by keeping our eyes on the ball and making low-risk choices.
