      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">ANTONIO: So, the reality is, anyone who makes high-risk choices can have impairment problems?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:10.00">MICHELLE: Right, high-risk choices up the risk for impairment problems--and research backs this up. We can't avoid problems by using a designated driver or compensating with "extra effort."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MICHELLE: There's only one way to prevent impairment problems. It's simple, but it's not always easy; To prevent impairment problems, we have to prevent impairment.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: Thanks, Michelle. Remember how we talked about keeping our eye on the ball? Well, we can prevent impairment and future problems by keeping our eyes on the ball and making low-risk choices.</p>
