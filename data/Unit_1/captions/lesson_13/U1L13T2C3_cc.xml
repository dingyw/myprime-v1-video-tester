	   When people drink more alcohol than their liver can process at one time, the excess alcohol continues to circulate throughout the body. 
This excess alcohol disrupts the proper functioning of the brain and nerve cells, and thus the ability to respond becomes impaired. 
This happens because alcohol impacts how effectively our nervous system can pass messages between cells. 
So when impaired, it is impossible for the nervous system to perform as well as it does in a sober state. 
Extra effort and practice can help, but it cannot overcome alcohol or drug impairment.
When cells become impaired, we often can’t respond quickly enough or accurately enough to avoid problems… 
In some situations, a split second difference is all that stands between safety and tragedy.
