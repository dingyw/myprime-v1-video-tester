      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: When people drink more alcohol than their liver can process at one time, the excess alcohol continues to circulate throughout the body. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: This excess alcohol disrupts the proper functioning of the brain and nerve cells, and thus the ability to respond becomes impaired.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: This happens because alcohol impacts how effectively our nervous system can pass messages between cells.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: So when impaired, it is impossible for the nervous system to perform as well as it does in a sober state.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Extra effort and practice can help, but it cannot overcome alcohol or drug impairment.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: When cells become impaired, we often can't respond quickly enough or accurately enough to avoid problems...</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In some situations, a split second difference is all that stands between safety and tragedy.</p>
