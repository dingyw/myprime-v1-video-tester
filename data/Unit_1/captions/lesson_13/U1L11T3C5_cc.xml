      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: People sometimes point out that no one dies from a marijuana overdose. And you know what?  They're right.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: But unfortunately, this is often used as an argument that being high on marijuana is "safe," and doesn't increase risk for other problems, such as car crashes.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Research shows us that marijuana use does increase risk. So the question is, why are people misled?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Well first of all, the type of high created by marijuana is very different from the experience of alcohol impairment. This difference convinces many people that marijuana doesn't increase risk when driving.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: In addition, people who are impaired on marijuana and choose to drive often report that they slow down, and try to drive more carefully. </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: And as we've seen with alcohol, an assumption often gets made that, "Since I'm trying harder and I've done it many times without problems, I'll never have a problem."</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Also, the fact that most people arrested for DUI have been drinking increases the perception that marijuana use is safer than alcohol. But are these beliefs accurate?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: If we look more closely at the effects of marijuana, we can see how it could increase the risk for crashes.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Often people who are high on marijuana report that it really focuses their attention, it lets them hone in on one thing.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Laboratory tests of people using marijuana have repeatedly shown impairment in skills such as the ability to pay attention to more than one thing at a time,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">information processing, tracking moving objects, and perception of what is actually in front of them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: They also lose some peripheral vision, the ability to see things out here without actually turning to look at them. All of these skills and abilities are necessary for safe driving.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: When we are driving we have to constantly shift our attention among many things. Let's try something right now. I have a red ball here. I'd like for you to really focus on this ball now.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Now, without shifting your attention from the ball, can you see how many fingers I'm holding up over there?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: It's really difficult isn't it? When we are focused on one thing it's hard to see other things around us.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: If we're driving and are completely focused on the road in front of us, then we may not see the light change, or the car that is about to pull out in front of us.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: That is what can happen when marijuana impairs our driving skills. If you tried to shift your attention to see what I was doing over here, that's the very skill marijuana impairs. 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: If I have trouble constantly shifting my attention among many things, I'm much more likely to have a crash.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: So, what's the real-world effect of marijuana impairment? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Research done in 2004 found that drivers who smoked marijuana and had 5 or more nanograms of THC per milliliter of blood had a 6.6 increased odds of causing a fatal crash in which the impaired driver died.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Nanograms per milliliter is a way of measuring THC in the blood much like a blood alcohol level measures alcohol in the blood.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: People who smoke marijuana usually have a THC blood level between 5 and 200 nanograms/milliliter. In this 2004 study, the median THC blood content at the time the driver was causing a fatal crash was 12 nanograms.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Earlier we saw that a 0.10 blood alcohol level was linked to a 6 times increased risk for a fatal crash, and this study shows us that the risk is similar at typical levels of marijuana impairment.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: The research tells that while people may not die from a marijuana overdose, they are dying from marijuana DUI crashes.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Other research has shown when experienced marijuana users were allowed to smoke to their typical level of "high" and then were given a standard roadside sobriety test 90 minutes later, 94 percent failed the test.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Sixty percent still failed after 2.5 hours. The effects of marijuana impairment can also be seen in hospitals.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: One study looking at 1,023 consecutive patients admitted to a trauma center found about 35 percent tested positive for current marijuana use. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: They had blood levels of THC indicating they were impaired at the time of the trauma. About 35 percent of those coming to the trauma center tested positive for alcohol.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: The percent using alcohol before an injury and the percent using marijuana were almost identical. Fifty percent of each of those groups tested positive for both alcohol and marijuana.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Other research has also demonstrated that marijuana use increases risk for impairment problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: In driving simulator tests, experienced marijuana users smoking their typical amount of marijuana did attempt to drive more carefully. For example, they didn't try to pass a leading car as often.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: However, when they did assume it was safe to pass, they crashed more often than unimpaired drivers. Time distortion prevented them from being able to accurately assess when they could safely pass.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: In actual road tests, again experienced users attempted to control for their impairment by slowing down and increasing the distance from cars in front of them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: However, they missed objects in the road they needed to steer around or stop for.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: That study also found marijuana-impaired drivers did a poor job of staying in their own lane compared to drivers not impaired.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: So, findings from research on marijuana and impairment indicate that marijuana has more in common with alcohol than one might think. With substances, serious impairment and increased risk for injury results.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: And people are likely to be impaired long before they believe they are impaired.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLAN: Plus, those who sense they are impaired are likely to believe they can compensate for the impairment to a much greater degree than is actually true.</p>
