      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">ANTONIO: So, what about drugs and impairment?  There are a lot of people who wouldn't ever drive drunk, but don't think twice about driving under the influence of drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:07.00">LISA: I believed that it was acceptable for me to drive while high on marijuana, because it wasn't the same as alcohol.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:13.00">LISA: That was my conception about it--that, you know, I know what it's like to feel drunk, I know what it's like to feel high, they're two different feelings. If I can drive drunk, I surely can drive high.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: Now, we'll take a look at what research says about driving under the influence of drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: When people hear the phrase, "Driving under the influence," they usually think of alcohol. But, really it can refer to any substance that causes impairment.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: This includes drugs that people used to get high and medications that aren't used to get high.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ANTONIO: And just as with alcohol, people driving under the influence of drugs are less likely to wear a seatbelt, or a helmet if they're riding a motorcycle, which further increases their risk for injuries and even fatalities.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:07.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: Researchers have examined the risks associated with driving while under the influence of specific drugs.  Click on the ones you'd like to learn more about.</p>
