      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Now it's time to learn about the phases. This is critical information, so we've enlisted the help of Frosty and Ejna—experts on the four phases of use. Thanks for joining us. The first of the four phases we call the Green Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: And the Green Phase is very straightforward, it's characterized by low-risk choices. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: And "low-risk" here is very specific--people in the Green Phase do not use drugs, and if they choose to drink, they follow the low-risk guidelines--0-1-2-3.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: And we should point out—that's a lot of people. By far, most people are making low-risk choices, and therefore they're in the Green Phase. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, I assume we call it "green" because there is less risk for health or impairment problems?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: That's right.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Alright, let's watch this clip to get a better idea of how people in this Phase relate to alcohol.</p>
