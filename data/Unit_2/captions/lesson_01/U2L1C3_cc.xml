        NARRATOR:
        
	   People in the green phase who drink generally have a "take-it-or-leave-it" feeling about alcohol. If they are watching a football game, or at a party and alcohol is available, that's fine. If not, that's fine too. They don't feel strongly about it either way.

	   Hey, Miguel. There's some food over there and I think there's a beer in the fridge.

        NARRATOR:
        
	   People in the green phase may drink, but they don't use illegal drugs at all, and they use prescription drugs only according to the directions.
