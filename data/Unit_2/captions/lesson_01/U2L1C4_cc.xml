      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">ANTONIO: So Frosty, these guys are having a good time without making high-risk choices. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: Absolutely. They love sports, they love being with each other. The good times in the Green Phase are all about relationships and activities with family and friends. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:05.00">FROSTY: People in the Green Phase have a "take it or leave it" attitude or feeling about drinking. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:10.00">EJNA: Right, so, I may enjoy a beer, but I'm going to have fun with or without the alcohol. And since I'm making low-risk choices, I'm not going to have an increase in tolerance. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:05.00">EJNA: But remember, we're talking about alcohol hereâ€”people in the Green Phase do not use drugs. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:07.00">FROSTY: People in the Green Phase do not use drugs. Therefore they reduce their risk for future problems with drugs or alcohol. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:07.00">EJNA: People can stay in the Green Phase for their entire lives, as long as they are consistently making low-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: And that isn't to say that some people don't move out of the Green Phase--some do--they experiment with high-risk choices for a variety of reasons.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: But many of those people also for a variety of reasons return to the Green Phase and stay there for a lifetime.</p>
