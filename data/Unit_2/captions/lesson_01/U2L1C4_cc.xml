	   So Frosty, these guys are having a good time without making high-risk choices

	   Absolutely. They love sports, they love being with each other. The good times in the Green Phase are all about relationships with family and friends. People in the Green Phase have a “take it or leave it” attitude or feeling about drinking.

	   Right, so, I may enjoy a beer, but I'm going to have fun with or without the alcohol. And since I'm making low-risk choices, I'm not going to have an increase in tolerance. But remember, we’re talking about alcohol here—people in the Green Phase do not use drugs.

	   People in the Green Phase do not use drugs.  Therefore they reduce their risk for future problems with drugs or alcohol. 
      </p>

	   People can stay in the Green Phase for their entire lives, as long as they are consistently making low-risk choices.

	   And that isn't to say that people don't move out of the Green Phase--some do--they experiment with high-risk choices for a variety of reasons. But many of those people also for a variety of reasons return to the Green Phase and stay there for a lifetime.
