      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:12.75">ANTONIO: Okay, so let's quickly review what we learned about the Green Phase. The Green Phase is characterized by low-risk choices, and people in the Green Phase follow the "0-1-2-3 Guidelines."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Because people in this phase are making low-risk choices, they don't become impaired, and have no significant increase in tolerance.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: If they drink, they have a '"take-or-leave-it"' feeling about alcohol. They don't use illegal drugs at all, and if they use any medications, they take them as prescribed by a doctor.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: People in the Green Phase aren't likely to develop alcohol or drug related problems. And if they continue making low-risk choices, they can protect the things they value and stay in the Green Phase for life.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: But if people in the Green Phase start making high-risk choices, they will progress to the Yellow Phase, which we're going to talk about next.</p>
