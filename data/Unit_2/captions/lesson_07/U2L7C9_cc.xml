      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: So, it's easy for someone to view them as isolated events instead of seeing a pattern. As a result, people in the Orange or Red Phases may continue to drink or use while their lives slowly fall apart.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: So, next we are going to create a timeline of our own experiences with alcohol or drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: The more detailed and honest you are, the more helpful it will be. Start with your age or the year you had your first drink or used drugs for the first time.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: When did you first get drunk or high? When did you have your first blackout, arrest, fight, lose a job, get divorced, or experience other problems related to your use?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: Think of everything you've experienced and add it to your timeline.</p>
