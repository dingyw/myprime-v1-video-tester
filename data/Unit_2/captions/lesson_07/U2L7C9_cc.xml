      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: In this program, we looked at the experiences of the spiral compressed into a short period of time.  But in real life, these experiences often span months or years.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, it's easy for someone to view them as isolated events instead of seeing a pattern. As a result, people in the Orange or Red Phases may continue to drink or use while their lives slowly fall apart.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: If we become conscious of our own experiences, it can help us break free from the effects of the spiral. If we fail to do that, then we're likely to continue experiencing problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Any of us can do this type of self-assessment, but it takes some honest self-examination. So, next we are going to create a timeline of our own experiences with alcohol or drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: The more detailed and honest you are, the more helpful it will be. Start with your age or the year you had your first drink or used drugs for the first time.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: When did you first get drunk or high? When did you have your first blackout, arrest, fight, lose a job, get divorced, or experience other problems related to your use?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Think of everything you've experienced and add it to your timeline.</p>
