	   Every coin has two sides. 
We’ve talked a lot about the problems related to high-risk choices, but there are benefits too—otherwise people wouldn’t do it.  You can probably think of a few pretty easily, starting with the immediate, positive benefits.  This is especially true in the moment we want to use.
But when I make choices, it's like picking up a coin; there is no way to get just one side of it.  I can’t take just one side of my choices; I always get the good with the bad. 
Now we’re going to do an activity to help us take a closer look at both sides of our alcohol and drug choices, so we can make more informed choices in the future.
