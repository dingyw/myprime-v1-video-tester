	   Letâ€™s take a closer look at pros and cons. It's pretty safe to say that most of us want to avoid the cons of high-risk choices, just as most of us would want to experience the benefits that come with low-risk choices. But remember, I can't just pick up one side of a coin, and I can't get just one side of my choices. I always get both the good and the bad.
In choosing to accept the pros of high-risk choices, I am also choosing to accept the cons of high-risk choices. If I've been making high-risk choices, to pros of making high-risk choices may outweigh the cons in the short term, but, if I continue to make high-risk choices, the cons of my high-risk choices will eventually outweigh the pros in the long term. 
Making low-risk choices, on the other hand, will be uncomfortable to deal with in the short term, but if I deal with that short-term discomfort and continue to make low-risk choices,I will be rewarded by the pros of my low-risk choices in the long term. Imagine putting your own pros and cons for making low-risk choices on a scale. What carries more weight on the scale today. Then, think about what you want for the future. What will weigh more for you in the long term?
