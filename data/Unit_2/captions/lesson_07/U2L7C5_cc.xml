      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Here's an example.  Just about everyone is aware that their arrest, divorce, or job loss is costly. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: But most of us aren't aware of how much these problems actually cost. Sometimes the costs get so spread out that we lose track of the total.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: We can learn a lot by determining how much our problems really cost us, so in the next activity we'll do just that. Before we start calculating, you'll need to answer some questions.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Remember, your responses will be completely confidential.</p>
