	   Here is a timeline for you to map out what your past experiences have been with alcohol and/or with drugs. Enter an event or a memory on your timeline and give it a date. Don't worry, it doesn't have to be exact. You can also enter a longer description if there are details you want to capture from your memory. This is your personal history, so give yourself time to reflect on your experiences, and to work with your timeline. Remember, no one's going to see your timeline but you.
