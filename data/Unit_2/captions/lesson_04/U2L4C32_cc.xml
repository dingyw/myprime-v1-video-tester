      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Remember, there are two types of problems that people might experience: impairment problems and health problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Problems are rare in the Green Phase, not uncommon in the Yellow Phase, very common in the Orange Phase, and almost always present in the Red Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: As we progress through the phases, we increase the quantity and frequency of our high-risk choices, thus increasing the risk for health and impairment problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Health problems become likely when we make high-risk choices over a period of months or years.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: This can include damage to any organ and includes risk for addiction, which arises from changes to the brain â€“ not always damage to the brain itself, but damaged brain functions.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Impairment problems can happen any single time we are impaired. The more often we become impaired, the more likely we are to experience impairment problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: We can think of an impairment problem like the number six on dice. It might happen the first time or it might happen the 57th time; but sooner or later, if I keep tossing the dice, the six will turn up.</p>
