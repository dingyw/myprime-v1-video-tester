      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">NARRATOR: Remember what happens in the brain when we make high-risk choices? The alcohol or drugs push our brain in one direction and then it rebounds in the other.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: In the Green Phase, low-risk choices have little impact on the brain and so we see little or no rebound.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: In the Yellow Phase, high-risk choices push our brain out of its normal range of function and so we see some short-term rebound effects.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: For example, after using a stimulant drug, a person can feel emotionally down for a few days.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:36.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: In the Orange Phase, rebound effects become more powerful. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: We saw how people using alcohol can rebound back to being jittery or anxious, while those using marijuana to focus may find it harder to get focused when they are not high.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: These effects increase psychological dependence since people feel they must use again to manage the rebound.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:01.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: In the Red Phase these rebound effects can become so powerful that they make up much of what we call withdrawal.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:09.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: These rebound effects can cause people to use even more as they try to avoid the withdrawal. This, coupled with the loss of control seen in this phase will make it even harder to stop.</p>
