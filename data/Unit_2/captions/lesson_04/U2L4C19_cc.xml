	   We've talked about problems that might occur in the Yellow or Orange Phase, but what kind of problems might occur in the Red Phase?

	  In the Red Phase, people are likely to have more problems. More problems with family, with friends, relationship problems, job problems... Some of these may be very subtle, like not being as sharp on the job. Others are quite serious--an arrest for example, injuries, health problems, violence.

	  And some of these problems may be new in the Red Phase, or they may be problems that have been around for quite a long time, and have just been aggravated by continued high-risk use.

	  Frosty, can you give me some examples?

        FROSTY:
        
	   Sure, things like marriage problems, an unhappy marriage, say, or problems at school or work... depression, anxiety. All these problems may be made worseby continued high-risk use in the Red Phase. My struggle is, because these problems have been around for so long, I have difficulty connecting them to my high-risk use.

	   Yeah and I'd also like to point out that some people manage to keep the big problems away. They have successful businesses and manage to keep their lives in order. But this success does not mean that alcoholism or addiction is not present.
