      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">ANTONIO: We've talked about problems that might occur in the Yellow or Orange Phase, but what kind of problems might occur in the Red Phase?</p>     
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:10.00">EJNA: Well in the Red Phase, people are likely to have more problems. More problems with family, with friends, relationship problems, job problems...</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:13.00">EJNA: Some of these may be very subtle, like not being as sharp on the job. Others are quite serious--an arrest for example, injuries, health problems, even violence.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: And some of these problems may be new in the Red Phase, or they may be problems that have been around for quite a long time, and just aggravated by continued high-risk use.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: Frosty, can you give me some examples?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: Sure, things like marriage problems, an unhappy marriage, say, or problems at school or work... depression, anxiety.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:13.00">FROSTY: All these problems can be made worseby continued high-risk use in the Red Phase. My struggle is, because these problems have been around for so long, I have difficulty connecting them to my high-risk use.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:02.00" dur="00:00:12.00">EJNA: Yeah and I'd also like to point out that some people manage to keep the big problems away. They have successful businesses and manage to keep their life in order.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:14.00" dur="00:00:06.00">EJNA: But this success does not mean that alcoholism or addiction is not present.</p>
