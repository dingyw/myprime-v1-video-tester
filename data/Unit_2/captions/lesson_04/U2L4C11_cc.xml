	Defense mechanisms, another component of psychological dependence, also become stronger in the Red Phase. As the alcohol or drug use is becoming more destructive, the defense mechanisms have to become more complicated and more deeply entrenched to work. And they do work.
By the Red Phase, psychological dependence has progressed to a point at which few people are capable of overcoming it on their own.  So, people in the Red Phase will often benefit from help either from counselors trained in addictions, or from people who have been there themselves and are now in recovery.
