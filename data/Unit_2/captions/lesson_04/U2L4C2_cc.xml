      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">ANTONIO: Now let's talk about the Red Phase. What makes it different from the Orange Phase?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:08.00">EJNA: Well actually, someone in the Red Phase can have all the same characteristics as someone in the Orange Phase, they're just going to be more intense.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:08.00">EJNA: But what separates, the Orange Phase from the Red Phase, or makes it different, is the addition of physical addiction in the Red Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: So, if I'm in the Red Phase... I've passed my trigger level?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:07.00">FROSTY: Right, but you may not know it, because it's not easy to identify when we pass the trigger level. And addiction is oftentimes misunderstood.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:10.00">EJNA: Yeah, it is, and it's because we talk about so many things as addictions, like work addiction and love addiction and chocolate addiction. The real meaning of the word gets lost.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Okay, let's see what addiction really involves, what it looks like, and what it feels like.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:12.00">GEORGE: My experiences of what drug addiction is and what it does is pure hell. It will either kill you or leave you totally incapacitated.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:11.00">LISA: When I was about 21, like I said, I started using cocaine. At first it was just a recreational thing I did on the weekends, every here and there.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:13.00">LISA: But after about, I'de say six or seven months it became where I was maxing out credit cards to get cash advances to buy it and I was doing it before I went to work, I was doing it when I came home.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:15.00">LISA: This probably went on for about a year or two, this way. So defintely the recreational part had obviously went out the window, when I realised, oh, wow, this is part of my everyday function. This is what I am doing every single day.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:38.00" dur="00:00:14.00">MIKAEL: I used coke to keep me up so I could drink, pretty much. And the two combined, I would say was the best combination that I had found.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.00" dur="00:00:21.00">MIKAEL: I took all... It just kept progressing to the point where, towards the end it was, you know, I was using coke by myself and finding little bottles of vodka where I could drink if I had to pound 1 or 2 minitures in the bathroom...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.00" dur="00:00:10.00">MIKAEL: ...and then I was, I was teaching school at the time.  So, I'm not proud of it but that's just the way it was.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:23.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RACHEL: And it got to the point where I was drinking at home all the time. I wasn't out anymore. I wasn't social anymore</p>
      <p begin="00:02:29.00" dur="00:00:17.00">RACHEL: So, it started... My day ended technically at 5 o'clock cause that's when my drinking started and it got to the point where I was hiding and I was drinking mass quantities in short periods of time.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.00" dur="00:00:12.00">GEORGE: My use of heroin was for about 2 years. Heroin scared me so bad because I didn't have control. With heroin, when I woke up in the morning, I had to go get some heroin. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:58.00" dur="00:00:12.00">GEORGE: There was no "wait a minute, later"--when I woke up in the morning and I had a heroin addiction, I had to feed that addiction daily. It woke me up, it was my master.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:10.00" dur="00:00:11.00">GEORGE: With other types of drugs like alcohol or marijuana, I had leeway, I could get up, I didn't have to, but heroin for me was hell. It was pure hell.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:21.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: So, if I'm in the Red Phase, am I drinking or using drugs every day?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:27.00" dur="00:00:02.00">FROSTY: Well maybe, but not necessarily.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:29.00" dur="00:00:12.00">FROSTY: People who are in the Red Phase routinely make high-risk choices around alcohol or drugs but they don't necessarily do that every day, and when it comes to alcohol, I may not do it every time I drink.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:41.00" dur="00:00:06.00">FROSTY: But if you look at the scope of my life, it's obvious that alcohol and drugs have become very important.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.00" dur="00:00:10.00">EJNA: Right. And it's because the level of use has become so integrated into the person's life, at this point that it's brought on profound brain changes that are associated with addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.00" dur="00:00:13.00">GEORGE: The cravings that I had in my body, they just felt like a longing, they felt like a cold emptiness that was there, and I could always remember especially when I was using heroin how warm it felt.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:11.00" dur="00:00:14.00">GEORGE: Heroin felt warm, when you used it, it felt warm coursing through your body. And that craving was a coldness that would try to convince me that I needed to get that warmth again to feel right.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTHONY: At first it started with never doing it by myself, then it started back at home with marijuana and I made that like a rule, "never smoke by myself." </p>
      <p begin="00:04:36.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTHONY: And then I got into the Army and I can't smoke marijuana anymore. So I started smoking spice which is a synthetic form of marijuana.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:47.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTHONY: Like at first I started doing it with a friend but then eventually it just got to the point where I was doing it just by myself, in my room.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:56.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ANTHONY: Then, like, I didn't realize how I've, how I slowly progressed into... And then like, points I'de just be sitting there like, yeah, I'd like to get high right now but...</p>
      <p begin="00:05:11.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTHONY: Or like, I would really want to... Or like, I NEED to... </p>
