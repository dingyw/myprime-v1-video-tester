      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Now let's talk about the Red Phase. What makes it different from the Orange Phase?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: Well actually, someone in the Red Phase can have all the same characteristics as someone in the Orange Phase, they're just going to be more intense.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: But what separates, the Orange Phase from the Red Phase, or makes it different, is the addition of physical addiction in the Red Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, if I'm in the Red Phase... I've passed my trigger level?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Right, but you may not know it, because it's not easy to identify when we pass the trigger level. And addiction is oftentimes misunderstood.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: Yeah, it is, and it's because we talk about so many things as addictions, like work addiction and love addiction and chocolate addiction. The real meaning of the word gets lost.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, let's see what addiction really involves, what it looks like, and what it feels like.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: My experiences of what drug addiction is and what it does is pure hell. It will either kill you or leave you totally incapacitated.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">LISA: When I was about 21, like I said, I started using cocaine. At first it was just a recreational thing I did on the weekends, every here and there. 
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:01.00">LISA: But after about, I'de say six or seven months it became where I was maxing out credit cards to get cash advances to buy it and I was doing it before I went to work, I was doing it when I came home.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:01.00">LISA: This probably went on for about a year or two, this way. So defintely the recreational part had obviously went out the window, when I realised, oh, wow, this is part of my everyday function. This is what I am doing every single day.</p>

      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: My use of heroin was for about 2 years. Heroin scared me so bad because I didn't have control. With heroin, when I woke up in the morning, I had to go get some heroin. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: There was no "wait a minute, later"--when I woke up in the morning and I had a heroin addiction, I had to feed that addiction daily. It woke me up, it was my master.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: With other things like alcohol or marijuana, I had leeway, I could get up, I didn't have to, but heroin for me was hell. It was pure hell.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: My withdrawal from heroin was like a very bad flu--a very bad touch of the flu, where my body ached, everything ran from my body, I was irritable, I couldn't sleep, I didn't have an appetite.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: And all I could think about was the warmness that heroin could give me. It was terrible.</p>
   
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, if I'm in the Red Phase, am I drinking or using drugs every day?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Maybe, but not necessarily. People who are in the Red Phase routinely make high-risk choices around alcohol or drugs every day, and when it comes to alcohol, I may not do it every time I drink.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: But if you look at the scope of my life, it's obvious that alcohol and drugs have become very important.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: Right. And it's because the level of use has become so integrated into the person's life, that it's brought on profound brain changes that are associated with addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: The cravings that I had in my body, they just felt like a longing, they felt like a cold emptiness that was there, and I could always remember when I was using how warm it felt.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: Heroin felt warm, when you used it, it felt warm coursing through your body. And that craving was a coldness that would try to convince me that I needed to get that warmth again to feel right.</p>
