	  Yes, but in the Red Phase it becomes much more profound and actually takes on a different nature.

	Remember those key elements to psychological dependence described in the Orange Phase?
One of those key puzzle pieces was something we referred to as “integration into life.”

	   Right, so by the time someone moves into the Red Phase, the alcohol and drugs have become so integrated, that if I was forced to choose between the high-risk choices and protecting the things I value, it is very hard to predict what I’d do. Now early on, people may choose to protect the relationship, so they’ll give up the high-risk choices. Later on, almost anything can lose out to the high-risk use.

	   Right, and for many people in the Red Phase, they wind up losing things that they value a great deal until they finally reach the point where the cost is just too great and they actually stop.

	  I had gotten to the point where the alcohol for me was the... I use the word reward, but it really wasn't, it was a part of me. It was... I didn't know how to function without it, I didn't know how to live with that "reward," as I called it, at 5 o'clock. It got pretty bad.

	  The issue is, is that an alcoholic is gonna find booze no matter where he is. It just becomes one of those situations. As they say, two people stranded on an iceberg, in the middle of the ocean, the alcoholic will find something to drink, some liquor. And that’s what happens in the military. They have general order number one, it’s usually around no drinking in the theater of operation—but there’s a lot of drinking going on, no matter where they are.
