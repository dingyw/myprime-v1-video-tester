	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Yes, but in the Red Phase it becomes much more profound and actually takes on a different nature. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: How so?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Remember those key elements to psychological dependence described in the Orange Phase? One of those key puzzle pieces was something we referred to as "integration into life."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA:  Right, so by the time someone moves into the Red Phase, the alcohol and drugs have become so integrated, that if I was forced to choose between the high-risk choices and protecting the things I value, it is very hard to predict what I'd do.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA:  Now early on, people may choose to protect the relationship, so they'll give up the high-risk choices. Later on, almost anything can lose out to the high-risk use.</p>	  
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Right, and for many people in the Red Phase, they wind up losing things that they value a great deal until they finally reach the point where the cost is just too great and they actually stop.</p>	  
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: I had gotten to the point where the alcohol for me was the... I use the word reward, but it really wasn't, it was a part of me. It was...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: I didn't know how to function without it, I didn't know how to live with that "reward," as I called it, at 5 o'clock. It got pretty bad.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ART: The issue is, is that an alcoholic is gonna find booze no matter where he is. It just becomes one of those situations.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ART: As they say, two people stranded on an iceberg, in the middle of the ocean, the alcoholic will find something to drink, some liquor. And that's what happens in the military.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ART: They have general order number one, it's usually around no drinking in the theater of operationâ€”but there's a lot of drinking going on, no matter where they are.</p>
