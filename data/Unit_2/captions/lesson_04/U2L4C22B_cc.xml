      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:05.75">ANTONIO: So, if I've progressed to the point of addiction, and I've got all these things going on... what are my options?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.00" dur="00:00:10.00">FROSTY: Well, one option is to continue using. Another option would be to begin abstaining, in which case I have an opportunity to regain some of the things I value most in life.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:11.00">EJNA: So, if I'm in the Red Phase, I can seek help, stop my use, and put my life back together. It can be very difficult, but millions of people have done it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: But people often need help.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:10.00">EJNA: They do. And they do because the brain changes. These are powerful changes that create both the psychological dependence and the physical addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:14.00">EJNA: So when somebody enters into recovery early on, it's just about clearing the body of the alcohol or drugs. But then long-term recovery can begin, and that is when people can start reversing the brain changes that have occured.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:10.00">FROSTY: But of course, this process is going to take time. Many people in the Red Phase are going to need some professional support as well as a lot of help from the people around them in order to succeed.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:09.00">FROSTY: But if I'm in the Red Phase, I can find support for recovery through Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, and other support groups.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:12.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: There's so much to think about. We've digested a lot of information about the progression. At this point-- what would you want people to remember most about the phases?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:09.00">EJNA: Well one important thing is that for different people, or different drugs, the trigger level can actually be higher or lower than we've illustrated.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:32.00" dur="00:00:11.00">EJNA: So, for some people, the progression from high-risk choices into addiction could actually happen more quickly if their trigger level is lower, or if they're using a more addictive substance.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:43.00" dur="00:00:10.00">FROSTY: And once I am in the Red Phase, the only low-risk choice that remains for me is total abstinence--because the progression at this point is irreversible.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:53.00" dur="00:00:09.00">FROSTY: For anybody who has not yet crossed their trigger level, the progression is reversible, so long as they make a commitment to following their low-risk guidelines.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:14.00">FROSTY: So when you think about it, people in the Orange Phase are at a particularly critical point in their lives, because if they do not return to the Green Phase through low-risk choices, by default they progress to the Red Phase.</p>
