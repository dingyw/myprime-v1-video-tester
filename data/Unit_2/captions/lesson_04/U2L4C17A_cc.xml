      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: I experienced blackouts a lot, especially towards the end of my drinking career. Waking up in my car, not knowing how I got there, things like that.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: That happened fairly frequently, I'd lose 12 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, if it was a good weekend... if I had the weekend off.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: I wasn't surprised by any of my behavior. And if my friends told me, "Hey, two nights ago you were doing this," I'd say, "Okay... I didn't think I was functional, but whatever.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MACKENZIE: One particular incident that sticks out to me was Homecoming, probably my Junior year. One of my friends came down to visit, and we decided to go to the biggest frat party outside, and we drank and drank and drank.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MACKENZIE: They had this big cooler full of "Jungle Juice," and instead of drinking water to hydrate, I drank that.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MACKENZIE: I had this container that was pretty large, and the two of us consumed enough alcohol that the two of us ended up not remembered much of what had happened that day. We woke up, and did not remember how we got there.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MACKENZIE: It kind of was a little scary, us being two females that are getting home while there's a bunch of drunken guys, and non concept as to how we got there, which route we took to get home, or if we hooked up with anyone.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MACKENZIE: But, the end of the month came, and you get your little statement on your credit card—Oh, we stopped at a couple other bars, apparently we got two pizzas, and we ate two pizzas apparently between the two of us.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MACKENZIE: We hear stories from friends of ours later, and they say, "Great party!" And we think, where, when? It's kind of scary, and again another eye-opener as to thinking "your life is so out of control that you can't even remember what you do."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MACKENZIE: It's pretty scary to know that you're not in control of your life and your actions. A lot of things can happen—people will take advantage of you as your vulnerable, and you just don't know about it until later.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BRAD: When I first started having blackouts, I almost didn't believe that it was true. I heard one night that I was out at a friend's place, and they had to carry me upstairs and put me to bed.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BRAD: I completely accused them of lying—they gotta be kidding, I know I drank a lot, but this can't be true. Then, a few months later, I started having blackouts that I knew was true because I'd be coming home from the bar—at the bar, excuse me...</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BRAD: A few months later I'd be having blackouts that I knew were really blackouts because one minute I'd be at the bar, the next minute I'd be waking up in my bed at home,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">somehow managing to drive home, across the city, without getting into an accident or killing somebody.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BRAD: Those were scary at first, but not enough to keep me from drinking. It got scarier and scarier.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BRAD: I also took some pride in being a high-functioning blackout person—I could drive a car, I could function as a bartender, and balance a thousand-dollar cash drawer and carry on a conversation while blacked out.</p>
