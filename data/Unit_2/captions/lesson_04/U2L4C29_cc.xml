	   Tolerance increases in response to the impairment which results from high-risk quantities of alcohol or drugs. Tolerance represents our body trying to adjust, trying to be normal again, and trying to keep our brain in charge of our actions.
In the Green Phase, there is no impairment, so there is nothing for our brain to adjust to.
In the Yellow Phase, each time we become impaired, our brain jumps into action and starts adapting to try and get back in charge. Our high-risk alcohol or drug use is literally changing our brain.
This happens fairly quickly. In fact, small increases in tolerance can even happen after one episode of impairment.
Over time, these changes accumulate and become noticeable. We start finding that we have to use more to get the effect we want. This starts a cycle where our tolerance goes up because we use more, then we use more because our tolerance has gone up. And then we repeat that cycle over and over.
As we move into the Orange Phase we find that our physical tolerance, when it comes to things like walking and talking can get quite high. It might take 2 to 3 times more alcohol or drugs than it used to before we feel impaired or intoxicated.
During the Red Phase, tolerance continues to increase. But late in the Red Phase physical damage causes some people to experience a drop in tolerance. As a result, they may become impaired from smaller amounts of alcohol or drugs. They can no longer predict what their reaction to drugs and alcohol will be. This increases the risk of both impairment problems and overdose.
