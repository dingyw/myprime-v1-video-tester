      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">NARRATOR: Our brain's executive functions are subtle but very important. They allow us to make sense of things that we can't directly see or experience. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: They organize our memories, our sense of self and input about our environment. This allows us to make connections, prioritize, and plan how to act moment-by-moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: In the Green Phase, low-risk choices have no real impact on our brains.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: But in the Yellow Phase, high-risk choices begin to change the brain's frontal lobes where our executive functions are located.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:15.00">NARRATOR: It gets harder to organize our thoughts, to plan, or to think clearly even after the alcohol or drug is out of our system. This effect lingers for a few hours to a few days, depending on how impaired we were.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: In the Orange Phase, ongoing high-risk choices begin to chronically interfere with our executive functions even when we're not drunk or high.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:05.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: For example, research has shown regular users of morphine, stimulants, marijuana or high-risk amounts of alcohol can have problems with planning, attention or memory.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:18.00" dur="00:00:17.00">NARRATOR: By the Red Phase, my high-risk choices have created a powerful mental link between using, pleasure and stress relief. Anytime I think of relaxing or celebrating, the alcohol or drug use spontaneously appears in my thoughts.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:35.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: It becomes hard to think of living my life without making high-risk choices. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: Over time, impulsive alcohol or drug use becomes compulsive due to a powerful motivation to use that builds in the brain and causes loss of control.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: At the same time, my abstract thinking becomes impaired, so I may not be able to see the connections between my choices, my values and my problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:04.00" dur="00:00:17.00">NARRATOR: It becomes harder to see the problem clearly. And the impairment makes it more difficult to remember things, problem solve, stay on task, or focus. The more high-risk choices I make, the worse this condition becomes.</p>
