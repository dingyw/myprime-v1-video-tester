      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEREMY: I guess when you're going out, you think you're deadset on drinking 2, 3 beers, and you'll be good--but you know, once you get there, and you're in the moment,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">and you see everyone else having a good time I'd end up drinking more than I really intended.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEREMY: And then, I'd be in situations where I'd start drinking, you know, just a few, just hanging out, and I just couldn't stop. I don't know--is that an addiction? I started thinking about that--did I really have an addiction?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEREMY: I was headed off the deep end. I could go through a helf-gallon in one night, and literally... I've always heard "Drink yourself sober," but there were nights when I would go through a half-gallon and feel sober.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEREMY: I'd go to sleep and wake up the next day like nothing was going on--go to work, put the game face on, and act like nothing was happening, then go home and do the same thing again. Then I'd repeat the cycle for 18 straight days.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: I remember every morning I'd wake up and look around and think, "Is he mad? Is he not mad? What did I do? Can I put the pieces together?" </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: I'd go outside and say, "I'm not going to drink today, I'm not going to drink today." I felt so horrible.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: But by 11 o'clock, I'm thinking, "I feel fine, he really wasn't that mad. So, let's go to the grocery store and buy the Fruit Loops and the wine and the beer, and start the chaos all over again."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: Whenever I drank, I would set out a goal of drinking a certain amount, or not getting too drunk.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: But, I was never really able to control that. Sometimes I would be OK if I was time-limited, for example, if I only had a certain amount of time to drink.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: Or, if I was with people who didn't drink like me, I could sort of match pace with them. But, the bottom line was that when I started drinking I never really knew how much I was going to drink or when I was going to stop.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: And it was difficult for me to understand because I lot of the people I was with were heavy drinkers, and I would compare myself to them and I would think I was doing fine.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: But it was very difficult to know what was going to happen when I was drinking.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: I actually did a couple of silly things. First I thought "I'll solve this, I'll get everyone off my back." He challenged me, and said he bet I couldn't stop drinking for one week.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: And I said, "yes I can." It was the most miserable week of that man's life. I was on purpose just a bratty awful thing.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: The day after the week, I was in the grocery store, buying the bottles, brought them home and said, "See, I told you so." That was sort of silly.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: Then I thought a couple months later, "I'll buy some non-alcoholic wine, because maybe it's just a habit."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: And because I'm an alcoholic and I'm really crafty, I thought, "I could put real wine in the non-alcoholic bottles, and nobody will know the difference."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: A couple of days after that he asked how come I was still slurring and stumbling around if it's non-alcoholic, and I remember sitting across the table from him and asking if he wanted a glass.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: I remember pouring it and lying straight to his face. He knew everything, but I would just lie straight to his face.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: I would hide bottles, and part of my morning routine was seeing what was left and--I would hide them in different places, and again, think I'm really crafty--and he made a piece of paper and he typed out,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">"Do you really think I'm that stupid that I don't know what you're doing?"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ART: An alcoholic is gonna find booze no matter where he is.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ART: It becomes one of those situations where you think, two people are stranded on an iceberg in the middle of the ocean, and the alcoholic will find something to drink.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ART: That's what happens in the military--you have standing order #1, no drinking in the theater of operations, but there's a lot of drinking that goes on where they are.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: It got to the point where I was drinking at home all the time. I wasn't out any more, I wasn't sociable any more. My day ended at 5:00, because that's when I started drinking.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RACHEL: It got to the point where I was hiding, and I was drinking mass quantities in short periods of time.</p>
