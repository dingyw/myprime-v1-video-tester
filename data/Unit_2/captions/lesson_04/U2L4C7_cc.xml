      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">JEREMY: I guess when you're going out, you think you're deadset on drinking 2, 3 beers, and you'll be good--but you know, once you get there, and you're in the moment,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:05.00">and you see everyone else having a good time I'd end up drinking more than I really intended.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:19.00">JEREMY: And then, I'd be in situations where I'd start drinking, you know, just a few, just hanging out, and I just couldn't stop. I don't know--is that an addiction? I started thinking about that--did I really have an addiction?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:22.00">JEREMY: I was headed off the deep end. I could go through a helf-gallon in one night, and literally... I've always heard "Drink yourself sober," but there were nights when I would go through a half-gallon and feel sober.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:57.00" dur="00:00:18.00">JEREMY: I'd go to sleep and wake up the next day like nothing was going on--go to work, put the game face on, and act like nothing was happening, come back home and do the same thing. Then repeat the cycle for 18 straight days.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:15.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ERIC: Whenever I drank, I would set out a goal of drinking a certain amount, or not being too drunk.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:22.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ERIC: But, I was never really able to control that. Sometimes I would be OK if I was time-limited, for example, if I only had a certain amount of time to drink.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:34.00" dur="00:00:17.00">ERIC: Or, if I was with people who didn't drink like me, I could sort of match pace with them. But, the bottom line was that when I started drinking I never really knew how much I was going to drink or when I was going to stop.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:51.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ERIC: And it was difficult for me to understand because I lot of the people I was with were heavy drinkers or drank a lot, so I would compare myself to them and I would think I was doing fine.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:06.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ERIC: But it was very difficult to know what was going to happen when I was drinking.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:14.00" dur="00:00:14.00">RACHEL: I actually did a couple of silly things. First I thought "I'll solve this, I'll get everyone off my back." He challenged me, and said he bet I couldn't stop drinking for one week.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:27.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RACHEL: And I said, "I bet I can." It was the most miserable week of that man's life. I was on purpose just a bratty awful thing.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:39.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RACHEL: The day after the week, I was in the grocery store, buying the bottles, brought them home and said, "See, I told you so." That was sort of silly.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:51.00" dur="00:00:07.00">RACHEL: Then I thought a couple months later, "I'll buy some non-alcoholic wine, because maybe it's just a habit."</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:58.00" dur="00:00:15.00">RACHEL: And because I'm an alcoholic and I think I'm really crafty, after about 24 hours of that, I thought, "I could put real wine in the non-alcoholic bottles, and nobody will know the difference."</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:13.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RACHEL: So after 2 or 3 days of that that he asked how come I was still slurring and stumbling around if it's non-alcoholic, and I remember sitting across the table from him and he wanted a glass.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:24.00" dur="00:00:13.00">RACHEL: I poured it and lying straight to his face. He knew everything, but I would just lie straight to his face. It just didn't matter.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:37.00" dur="00:00:19.00">RACHEL: I was hiding bottles... part of my morning routine was seeing what was left and--I would hide them in different places, and again, think I'm really crafty--and he made a piece of paper and he typed out,</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:56.00" dur="00:00:05.00">"Do you really think I'm that stupid that I don't know what you're doing?"</p>
