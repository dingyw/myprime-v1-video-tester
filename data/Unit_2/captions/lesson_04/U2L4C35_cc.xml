	   Now when we do this assessment, some of us will find that our answers agree with the phase we think we are in. But some of us may question the results of the assessment.

	   So, people think they’re in one phase, but according to the assessment, they may be in another.

	   That can and does happen. So Antonio, why do you think it is that a person, say, in the Red Phase might actually think they’re in the Orange Phase, or somebody in the Orange Phase might think they’re in Yellow Phase, or even the Green Phase?

        <b>Antonio: </b>

	   I don’t know. Maybe they don’t see it? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty:</b>
        <br/>
	   Maybe they don’t see it, maybe they can’t see it, maybe they don’t want to see it. Maybe they’re defense mechanisms are tricking them. Maybe the self-assessment is wrong. These are all possible reasons why someone might think they’re in a phase that’s lower than they really are.
      </p>

	   And it’s not easy to accept that I may be in the Orange Phase or the Red Phase. If my self-assessment results indicate that I’m in a different phase than I think I’m in, it could be for any of these reasons.
But we do know it’s an important issue. When people believe they’re in a lower phase than they actually are, they’re likely to continue making high-risk choices. And if they do that, they’re going to put the things they value most in life at risk, and they’re also going to have more likelihood of experiencing problems.

	   So, at this point in the program, it’s not uncommon for people to feel a little anxious about their results of their self-assessment. Now keep in mind that the self-assessment is just that—it’s not a professional diagnosis. Nonetheless, it is quite accurate. And if a person is feeling anxious, troubled, maybe even a little scared, those feelings may be telling us something. Because how we each respond to this new information could not only be life-changing, it could be life-saving.

	   We’ve given you a lot to think about in this Unit. Take a moment to consider the information, and the experiences you’ve seen. We’ve got a couple more questions for you to answer.
