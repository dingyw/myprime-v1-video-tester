      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: During the early part of the Red Phase, the increase of tolerance looks very much like the increasing tolerance in the Orange Phase.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: But, tolerance changes as the Red Phase progresses.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: As the Red Phase continues, we may see erratic tolerance. This means that it may become hard to predict what effect the alcohol or drugs will have.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Because the body is increasingly damaged, it can no longer process alcohol or drugs as it used to.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Sometimes drinking or using the drug produces good feelings; other times the same amount does not. Sometimes the usual quantity causes impairment; other times it does not.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Finally, in the late Red Phase, we may see a decrease in tolerance. For the first time, tolerance begins to go down even as a person continues to make high-risk choices. The body is simply breaking down.</p>
