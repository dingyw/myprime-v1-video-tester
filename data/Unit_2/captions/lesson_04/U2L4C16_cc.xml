      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">NARRATOR: During the early part of the Red Phase, the increase of tolerance looks very much like the increasing tolerance in the Orange Phase.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:03.00">NARRATOR: But, tolerance changes as the Red Phase progresses.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: As the Red Phase continues, we may see erratic tolerance. This means that it may become hard to predict what effect the alcohol or drugs will have.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: Because the body is increasingly damaged, it can no longer process alcohol or drugs as it used to.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: Sometimes drinking or using the drug produces good feelings; other times the same amount does not. Sometimes the usual quantity causes impairment; other times it does not.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:45.00" dur="00:00:18.00">NARRATOR: Finally, in the late Red Phase, we may see a decrease in tolerance. For the first time, tolerance begins to go down even as a person continues to make high-risk choices. The body is simply breaking down.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MIKAEL: I certainly had a tolerance, though towards the end it was becoming unpredictable.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:24.00">MIKAEL: I knew how much beer I could drink, but my thing towards the end was vodka. Sometimes it would get me back to "normal," but sometimes it would just hit me, and I would go from normal to just blasted very quickly.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:35.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MIKAEL: And other times I would drink the same amount and it would be somewhat of a buzz. I just never knew... It was starting to become very unmanageable.</p>
