	   During the early part of the Red Phase, the increase of tolerance looks very much like the increasing tolerance in the Orange Phase. 
But, tolerance changes as the Red Phase progresses.
As the Red Phase continues, we may see erratic tolerance. This means that it may become hard to predict what effect the alcohol or drugs will have. 
Because the body is increasingly damaged, it can no longer process alcohol or drugs as it used to.
Sometimes drinking or using the drug produces good feelings; other times the same amount does not. Sometimes the usual quantity causes impairment; other times it does not. 
Finally, in the late Red Phase, we may see a decrease in tolerance. For the first time, tolerance begins to go down even as a person continues to make high-risk choices. The body is simply breaking down.
