      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: As my body adapts to higher levels of alcohol or drugs, it tolerates a larger amount as though it was normal. It now takes more to make me impaired.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: After a while, my body has thoroughly adapted to high levels of alcohol or drugs, so it treats that amount as normal and the absence as abnormal. When that happens, I may experience withdrawal if my blood alcohol or drug level drops.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Withdrawal is the experience of my body trying to adjust and function without alcohol or drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: We tend to think of alcohol and drug addiction primarily in terms of late-stage addiction, with very serious withdrawal. But many people have experienced early withdrawal without even knowing it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: They are likely to think they just had a particularly bad hangover. Let's look at the symptoms of withdrawal in early alcohol addiction. At first, I may only feel uneasy if i don't get a drink.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Early, mild withdrawal might include irritability, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, shakiness, difficulty in sleeping, or simply craving another drink. These are all symptoms of physical withdrawal.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Over time, I learn that alcohol or drugs will take that restlessness away. So, I end up self-medicating the restlessness without even knowing that I'm experiencing withdrawal, and that I'm in the early stages of addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In the Orange Phase, a person making high-risk choices may have an occasional drink when they wake up to ease a hangover. As the Red Phase progresses, wake-up drinking may become an essential follow-up to any night of heavy drinking.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Some people never experience withdrawal in the Red Phase because they never try to abstain or cut down on their drinking or drug use. They may drink at a "maintenance" level every day and not experience withdrawal until later in the phase.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: At that point, something unexpected like an illness may interrupt their drinking, and the withdrawal is likely to be very noticeable.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Most people in the Red Phase, however, do not drink every day and will experience some degree of withdrawal, at least at times.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Later in the Red Phase, withdrawal may be much more uncomfortable and dangerous. The severity of the withdrawal a person experiences is determined by how much the person they had to drink during that particular drinking episode.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Even one night of getting drunk may bring on very noticeable withdrawal. Virtually all of the drugs people use to get high can cause loss of control. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: So, each substance is addicting. This is true whether withdrawal occurs or not. Many people question, though, whether or not marijuana causes addiction, because withdrawal is not as noticeable.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Yet there is a distinct withdrawal syndrome that can occur with marijuana. This may include sleeplessness, irritability, craving, headaches and depression. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In fact, researchers have found that after chronic administration of THC, withdrawal can be induced in laboratory animals by giving them a THC blocker. This is evidence that marijuana can be physically addicting.</p>
