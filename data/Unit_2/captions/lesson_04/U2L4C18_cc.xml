      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">NARRATOR: As my body adapts to higher levels of alcohol or drugs, it tolerates a larger amount as though it was normal. It now takes more to make me impaired.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:16.00">NARRATOR: After a while, my body has thoroughly adapted to high levels of alcohol or drugs, so it treats that amount as normal and the absence as abnormal. When that happens, I may experience withdrawal if my blood alcohol or drug level drops.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Withdrawal is the experience of my body trying to adjust and function without alcohol or drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: We tend to think of alcohol and drug addiction primarily in terms of late-stage addiction, with very serious withdrawal. But many people have experienced early withdrawal without even knowing it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:45.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: They are likely to think they just had a particularly bad hangover. Let's look at the symptoms of withdrawal in early alcohol addiction. At first, I may only feel uneasy if I don't get a drink.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:57.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: Early, mild withdrawal might include irritability, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, shakiness, difficulty in sleeping, or simply craving another drink. These are all symptoms of physical withdrawal.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:15.00">NARRATOR: Over time, I learn that alcohol or drugs will take that restlessness away. So, I end up self-medicating the restlessness without even knowing that I'm experiencing withdrawal, and that I'm in the early stages of addiction.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:26.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: In the Orange Phase, a person making high-risk choices may have an occasional drink when they wake up to ease a hangover.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:33.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: As the Red Phase progresses, wake-up drinking may become an essential follow-up to any night of heavy drinking.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:40.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: Some people never experience withdrawal in the Red Phase because they never try to abstain or cut down on their drinking or drug use.</p>  
      <p begin="00:01:48.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: They may drink at a "maintenance" level every day and not experience withdrawal until later in the phase.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:54.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: At that point, something unexpected like an illness may interrupt their drinking, and the withdrawal is likely to be very noticeable.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: Most people in the Red Phase, however, do not drink every day and will experience some degree of withdrawal, at least at times.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:10.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Later in the Red Phase, withdrawal may be much more uncomfortable and dangerous.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:16.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: The severity of the withdrawal a person experiences is determined by how much the person they had to drink during that particular drinking episode.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:25.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: Even one night of getting drunk may bring on very noticeable withdrawal. Virtually all of the drugs people use to get high can cause loss of control. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: So, each substance is addicting. This is true whether withdrawal occurs or not. Many people question, though, whether or not marijuana causes addiction, because withdrawal is not as noticeable.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:48.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Yet there is a distinct withdrawal syndrome that can occur with marijuana. This may include sleeplessness, irritability, craving, headaches and depression. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: In fact, researchers have found that after chronic administration of THC, withdrawal can be induced in laboratory animals by giving them a THC blocker. This is evidence that marijuana can be physically addicting.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:11.00" dur="00:00:13.00">GARY: He gave me something called OxyContin which, if anybody has ever taken it, don't, it's the worst pill you can take cause even if you take it two perscriptions, like I did, it will punish you.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.00" dur="00:00:05.00">GARY: It punished me for six days when I went cold turkey on it, maybe shouldn't have done that but I didn't feel like I had a choice.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:29.00" dur="00:00:10.00">GARY: I felt like it was time to stop taking the pain killers but I was still in pain and my surgeon still gave me Darvocet, I told him nothing stronger.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:39.00" dur="00:00:06.00">GARY: I took those for a while. It put a crimp in my marriage, which is now over.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:45.00" dur="00:00:12.00">GARY: So, for the next 4 year I found ways to get painkillers, once I was given as clean bill of health, I was able to find them pretty much through anybody because at the time perscription use was very rampant,</p>
      <p begin="00:03:57.00" dur="00:00:09.00">especially in my circle. He gave me the OxyContin and as I said I had a six day withdrawal.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:06.00" dur="00:00:09.00">GARY: On the sisth day I got put into a psych ward because I couldn't handle the intensity of the withdrawal. It was like nothing I have ever felt.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:15.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ART: If I didn't have a drink in two hours, I would start to shake. I couldn't... I'de start to throw-up. It was not good and at the end of it I was throwing-up blood which is not good.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:25.00" dur="00:00:24.00">ART: My progression with the disease of alcoholism was such that they spent a couple stints in emergency rooms cause they thought I was having a heart attack, blood presure up at 198/138, super dehydration and the rest of it.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ART: The withdrawals were on a daily basis for me were incredible.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:53.00" dur="00:00:12.00">GEORGE: My withdrawal from herion, was like a very bad flu, a very bad touch of the flu, where my body and my bones ached, and my nose, and everything ran from my body.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:05.00" dur="00:00:15.00">GEORGE: I was iritable. I couldn't sleep. I didn't have an appetite. And all I could think about was the warmthness that some herion would give me at that time. It was terrible.</p>
