	 As my body adapts to higher levels of alcohol or drugs, it tolerates a larger amount as though it was normal. It now takes more to make me impaired. <br/>
After a while, my body has thoroughly adapted to high levels of alcohol or drugs, so it treats that amount as normal and the absence as abnormal. When that happens, I may experience withdrawal if my blood alcohol or drug level drops. Withdrawal is the experience of my body trying to adjust and function without alcohol or drugs. <br/>
We tend to think of alcohol and drug addiction primarily in terms of late-stage addiction, with very serious withdrawal. But many people have experienced early withdrawal without even knowing it. They are likely to think they just had a particularly bad hangover. <br/>
Let’s look at the symptoms of withdrawal in early alcohol addiction.  At first, I may only feel uneasy if i don’t get a drink. Early, mild withdrawal might include irritability, difficulty concentrating, restlessness, shakiness, difficulty in sleeping, or simply craving another drink. These are all symptoms of physical withdrawal. <br/>
Over time, I learn that alcohol or drugs will take that restlessness away. So, I end up self-medicating the restlessness without even knowing that I’m experiencing withdrawal, and that I’m in the early stages of addiction. <br/>
In the Orange Phase, a person making high-risk choices may have an occasional drink when they wake up to ease a hangover.  As the Red Phase progresses, wake-up drinking may become an essential follow-up to any night of heavy drinking. <br/>
Some people never experience withdrawal in the Red Phase because they never try to abstain or cut down on their drinking or drug use. They may drink at a “maintenance” level every day and not experience withdrawal until later in the phase. At that point, something unexpected like an illness may interrupt their drinking, and the withdrawal is likely to be very noticeable. Most people in the Red Phase, however, do not drink every day and will experience some degree of withdrawal, at least at times. <br/>
Later in the Red Phase, withdrawal may be much more uncomfortable and dangerous. The severity of the withdrawal a person experiences is determined by how much the person they had to drink during that particular drinking episode. Even one night of getting drunk may bring on very noticeable withdrawal. <br/>
Virtually all of the drugs people use to get high can cause loss of control. So, each substance is addicting. This is true whether withdrawal occurs or not. <br/>
Many people question, though, whether or not marijuana causes addiction, because withdrawal is not as noticeable. Yet there is a distinct withdrawal syndrome that can occur with marijuana. This may include sleeplessness, irritability, craving, headaches and depression. <br/>
In fact, researchers have found that after chronic administration of THC, withdrawal can be induced in laboratory animals by giving them a THC blocker. This is evidence that marijuana can be physically addicting.
