			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: What can we say about social dependence in the Red Phase?</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Interesting question, because while many of the things that we describe in the Orange Phase do intensify and carry forward into the Red Phase, something else might happen with social dependence.</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Now one, it might continue, and I might continue to surrund myself with people who drink like I do, and I might feel support from that system.</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: On the other hand, in the Red Phase, I might actually begin to isolate myself from others, and others may begin to drop out of my life.</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: And furthermore, I don't need a social support group to continue making my high-risk choices, because addiction is in control of my life. So in reality, addiction may disappear in the Red Phase.</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: And of course the external circumstances in my life were just completely out of control and falling apart, I didn't have a real job... at that point in my drinking, I didn't have a lot of friendships because people had just fallen away.</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: I was very isolated, and whenever people would ask me to do things, or try to be involved in my life, I would say no, or more often than not find an excuse to cancel plans with people.</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: I was very isolated and felt very alone. And, I think outwardly, people, if they had seen or knew what they were looking at, would have said, "This is a person who is in trouble. He's constantly isolated.</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: He doesn't have meaningful relationships with people in his life. He doesn't have the external structure that [for me now] makes life worth doing."</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: And, so, those things happening in combination with my drinking and all the depression I was experiencing around these things really left me in a position where I just felt empty. </p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Early in the Red Phase social dependence can look like the Orange Phase, but later in the phase, as their relationship with alcohol or drugs intensifies,</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">people often experience that their relationships become limited to others who are also in the Red Phase, or to suppliers or the substance itself...</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN AT THE BAR: Ooh it's 5 o'clock, we gotta go—Jen and Liz are waiting for us for dinner.</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MAN AT THE BAR: Actually you know, I'm good here.</p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN AT THE BAR: Are you sure? </p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MAN AT THE BAR: Yeah, have fun! </p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN AT THE BAR: Okay... Bye! </p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: They may not enjoy being around people who do not drink or use like they do. Drinking buddies may become our best friends, but the relationship is centered around use.
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Take away the drinking or drugs and there may be no basis for friendship. </p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MAN ON COUCH: Dude, what's goin' on? I was just gonna call you, do you wanna smoke? ... a movie? Uhh... I think I'm just gonna stay here. Alright, peace. </p>
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: We may get divorced or lose friendships with those who do not drink or use drugs like we do. </p>			
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: The experiences you are about to explore may not all be shared by every person in the Red Phase.</p> 
			<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: In fact, it is possible not to experience any of these problems and still be in the Red Phase. Now, keep in mind that loss of control—with or without problems—is what characterizes the phase.</p>
