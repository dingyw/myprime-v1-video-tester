      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In the Yellow Phase, changes in our brains increase our motivation to use. Then, in the Orange Phase, continued brain changes contribute to preoccupation, and lead us to use even more.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Now, in the Red Phase, those brain changes result in loss of control, which is the primary indicator of addiction.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Now, when we talk about loss of control it doesn't mean doing silly things while intoxicated, like dancing on a table or the bar. It's the inability to consistently regulate use, or make low-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: If I open a bottle, I may drink until it is empty. Or, I drink until the party's over, the bar's closed, I'm out of money, or something else forces me to stop.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: It's as if there's nothing inside me that takes over and says "enough."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: For other substances, such as marijuana or tobacco, loss of control might look a little different. For these substances it means we can no longer just use every now and then.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: I can abstain, or I can use most days, but I cannot use periodically. Attempting to control our drinking isn't the same thing as making an effort to reduce drinking to a low-risk quantity.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: If a person can consistently reduce their drinking to low-risk levels, they aren't in the Red Phase. On the other hand, efforts to control are sort of like building fences around drinking to help us stop at some point.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Here are some examples of attempts to control. I may only allowing myself to drink or use at certain times, like after 5 pm or on the weekend.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Or, I may try to control my drinking by taking a limited amount of money with me to the bar. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Alternately, I may bring someone with me who I think will keep me from drinking or using more than I plan. Changing brands, beverage type or drug type are other ways I may attempt to control use.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: For example I might say, "I can't do crystal anymore. From now on I'm only smoking weed." </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Efforts to control may also include periods of abstinence. We want to prove to ourselves and to others that we're in control. But, periodic abstinence doesn't prove anything.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: People who have alcoholism or drug addiction can abstain; otherwise they could never get well.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The primary treatment for alcoholism and addiction is abstinence. But what people in the Red Phase cannot do is consistently drink low-risk quantities of alcohol or just use drugs every now and then.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: People who are experiencing loss of control may experience an intense craving due to changes taking place in the brain.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: This craving creates a strong desire to use, but many people convince themselves that this time, they'll be able to control it. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: However, once they begin to use, they often experience loss of control and are unable to stay within low-risk quantities. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Sometimes people don't even know they're experiencing loss of control because they never try to control their drinking or drug use. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: This is particularly true of younger people out partying, or people very early in the Red Phase. Every time they drink or use they intend to get drunk or high, and they do!</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: These people may not realize they're experiencing loss of control until a major problem makes them try to cut back, and they find they cannot.</p>
