      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: The four phases of alcohol and drug use aren't tidy boxes we all fit into perfectly.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: We may not experience all the characteristics of a phase, but everyone can recognize their place somewhere along the phase progression.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: As we have seen, the Green Phase is characterized by low-risk choices. When it comes to alcohol, I can ‘take it or leave it.' When it comes to drugs, I leave it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: The Yellow Phase is marked by high-risk choices.  My ‘take it or leave it' attitude changes to anticipation, and I associate drinking and/or drug use with having fun.</p>   
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: And remember, any drug use automatically puts me in at least the Yellow Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: The Orange Phase is distinguished by psychological dependence where I develop a relationship with drugs or alcohol, and I may develop defenses to protect that relationship.  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: In the Orange Phase my drinking or drug use becomes integrated into my daily life, which may lead to extensive state-dependent learning.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Finally, the Red Phase is characterized by addiction. Here, I have passed my trigger level, and I can't consistently control my drinking or drug use.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: In addition, the spiral can keep me from seeing the ways my alcohol or drug use is causing problems.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Once I've entered the Red Phase, my only recommended low-risk choice is abstinence.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: And as I progress through the phases, brain changes can make it even harder for me to recognize how my choices are creating problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: But it's important to remember that no matter what phase we are in, we can learn to recognize where we are, and choose to make changes.  So, we have a choice to make... like in this story.</p>
