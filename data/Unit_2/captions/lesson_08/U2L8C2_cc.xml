	   The four phases of alcohol and drug use aren’t tidy boxes we all fit into perfectly. 
We may not experience all the characteristics of a phase, but everyone can recognize their place somewhere along the phase progression. 
As we have seen, the Green Phase is characterized by low-risk choices. When it comes to alcohol, I can ‘take it or leave it.’ When it comes to drugs, I leave it. 
The Yellow Phase is marked by high-risk choices.  My ‘take it or leave it’ attitude changes to anticipation, and I associate drinking and/or drug use with having fun.   And remember, any drug use automatically puts me in at least the Yellow Phase.
The Orange Phase is distinguished by psychological dependence where I develop a relationship with drugs or alcohol, and I may develop defenses to protect that relationship.  In the Orange Phase my drinking or drug use becomes integrated into my daily life, which may lead to extensive state-dependent learning.
Finally, the Red Phase is characterized by addiction. Here, I have passed my trigger level, and I can’t consistently control my drinking or drug use.  
In addition, the spiral can keep me from seeing the ways my alcohol or drug use is causing problems.  
Once I’ve entered the Red Phase, my only recommended low-risk choice is abstinence.
And as I progress through the phases, brain changes can make it even harder for me to recognize how my choices are creating problems.
But it’s important to remember that no matter what phase we are in, we can learn to recognize where we are, and choose to make changes.  So, we have a choice to make… like in this story.
