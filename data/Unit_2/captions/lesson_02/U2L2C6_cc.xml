      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:12.75">(Friendly arguing about a football game) NARRATOR: Let's see how that same game-watch might have played out if one of the guys was in the Yellow Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: People in the Yellow Phase begin to really enjoy high-risk choices, and feeling shifts from "take-it-or-leave-it" to "anticipation." (Continued arguing about a football game, doorbell rings)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:07.00">TRAVIS: I'll grab it. (Continued arguing about a football game)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:02.00">MIGUEL: What's up, Travis?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:34.00" dur="00:00:04.00">TRAVIS: Hey Miguel! We've gots some food over there, and I think we got a beer in the fridge. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:02.00">MIGUEL: Don't worry, I came prepared! You got room for these? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:04.00">TRAVIS: Yeah. (Continued arguing about a football game)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:44.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: When a person in the Yellow Phase gets together to watch a game, or hang out with friends, they look forward to the drinking or drugs about as much as they look forward to the event.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: It's now an important part of their social life, and doing these things without the alcohol or drugs doesn't seem like as much fun because drinking isn't just a part of a good time, it's the way to a good time.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: In the Yellow Phase, alcohol and drugs are often a central part of a person's social life and relationships.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: They believe it makes fun possible. This attitude makes drinking or drug use more important to them, so they are more likely to drink or use more.</p>
