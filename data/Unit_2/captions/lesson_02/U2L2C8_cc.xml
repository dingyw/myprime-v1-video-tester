      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">(Talking/joking about darts game) NARRATOR: As alcohol or drug use becomes more central to our social lives, we gravitate to people whose drinking or drug use is similar to our own.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Over time, these relationships become increasingly important which can lead to social dependence. (Talking/joking about darts game)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: Social dependence means our social group relies on high-risk drinking or drug use for its normal social functioning. This doesn't mean that people in the group pressure others to make high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: But it does mean that making high-risk choices is normal for any member of the group. It seems like "everybody does it." And if everybody does it, how "high-risk" can it be?

      <p begin="00:01:07.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: Would it feel as comfortable? Would it be as fun? You might even ask yourself, would they stay together at all? (Talking/joking about poker game)</p>
