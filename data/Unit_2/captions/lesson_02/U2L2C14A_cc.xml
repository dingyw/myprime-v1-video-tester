      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">ANTONIO: Okay, so this will probably be familiar by now... but anytime we make high-risk choices, we increase our risk for experiencing impairment problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: That sounds pretty clinical, doesn't it? Here's the kind of thing we're talking about. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:19.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Alcohol has made me once attempt to steal a schoolbus, which was almost very successful. I have set a golf cart on fire. I have had multiple D.W.I.s, and spent time in jail for it, which is not fun. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:08.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Close friends in college that had, you know accidents that involved drunk driving--and either people were hurt and they were hurt. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:08.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: I don't remember, I just woke up with a busted chin. My buddy said I got my ass kicked. I said, alright, I had too much. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Five years ago, I treated a Marine who was stabbed by someone who was drunk. That Marine was also drunk. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: Impairment problems can be serious, even life-changing. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:07.00" dur="00:00:18.00">MACKENZIE: Some of us made some poor decisions. Our inhibitions were down a lot. Guys would totally take advantage of women being sloppily drunk--kinda drooling and falling all over themselves. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:25.00" dur="00:00:10.00">MACKENZIE: There were some problems; some females, when they got drunk, turned into meatheads themselves, and if a girl looked at their boyfriend the wrong way... </p>
      <p begin="00:01:35.00" dur="00:00:13.00">there was an incident where two ROTC females got into it because a girl was talking to another one's boyfriend, and--no other intentions, just to talk--and the other girl got so drunk that she came over and kicked her in the face.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:48.00" dur="00:00:09.00">MACKENZIE: So... it's really not becoming of females to beef up and get into fights and stuff.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:57.00" dur="00:00:11.00">MACKENZIE: We're really vulnerable and a lot of guys, eventually, not only do they start taking advantage of that, but it was a really big turn-off too. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:08.00" dur="00:00:18.00">MIKAEL: My last year of school, when the wheels really started coming off--I got beat up, I got arrested twice... I got citations--and this was all in a matter of like six weeks.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Not everyone will experience an impairment problem, but every time we make high-risk choices we increase our risk for problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:36.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: In the last unit, we looked at what research tells us about the risks related to drinking and driving. But there are other risks to consider, as well. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:46.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: So, both high-risk drinking, and drugs people use to get high, can cause impairment problems in the Yellow Phase. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:53.00" dur="00:00:10.00">FROSTY: Sure, and that's not a surprise to most people. What may be a surprise is that even infrequent heavy use can also increase risk for certain health problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:03:03.00" dur="00:00:11.00">FROSTY: So while some people think it's dangerous to drink every day, they may also think it's okay, or "safe" somehow, to drink heavy ammounts as long as it's only on weekends. </p>
      <p begin="00:03:14.00" dur="00:00:10.00">FROSTY: And when people drink a large quantity very quickly, they increase their risk for alcohol overdose, which can include passing out, coma, perhaps even death. </p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.00" dur="00:00:11.00">FROSTY: And unfortunately for some who recover from the episode, they may experience lingering and perhaps permanent brain damage. This is particularly true if they're mixing drugs with the alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:35.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: So what are some other examples of problems people might experience in the Yellow Phase? </p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.00" dur="00:00:07.00">EJNA: There are many. For example, when people are making high-risk choices and having sex, they're less likely to use protection,</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:45.00" dur="00:00:08.00">and because of that, we see higher rates of both unwanted pregnancies or unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.00" dur="00:00:07.00">FROSTY: And we've known for some time that  some men, when intoxicated, become much more aggressive, both physically and sexually. </p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.00" dur="00:00:09.00">FROSTY: Current research also tells us that women who drink five or more drinks, increase their own risk for being a victim of sexual aggression by nine times;</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:09.00" dur="00:00:05.00">and increase their risk for being a victim of physical aggression by seven times.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:14.00" dur="00:00:12.00">FROSTY: Now make no mistake about it--the woman are still the victims here--but her risk may be not only a function of the man's high-risk choices, it's also a function of her own high-risk choices. </p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.00" dur="00:00:12.00">EJNA: And then coming back to the health problems--another example is, if we get intoxicated once or more in a week, we actually increase our risk for cardiovascular death by 2.4 times.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:38.00" dur="00:00:10.00">EJNA: So, what we learn from this is that when we make high-risk choices we're increasing our risk for both health and impairment problems in the Yellow Phase."</p>
