	   Okay, so this will probably be familiar by now… but anytime we make high-risk choices, we increase our risk for experiencing impairment problems. That sounds pretty clinical, doesn't it? Here's the kind of thing we're talking about.

	   Alcohol has made me once attempt to steal a schoolbus, which was almost very successful. I have set a golf cart on fire. I have had multiple D.W.I.s, and spent time in jail for it, which is not fun.

	   Some of us made some poor decisions. Our inhibitions were down a lot. Guys would totally take advantage of women being sloppily drunk--kinda drooling and falling all over themselves. There were some problems; some females, when they got drunk, turned into meatheads themselves, and if a girl looked at their boyfriend the wrong way... there was an incident where two ROTC females got into it because a girl was talking to another girl's boyfriend, and--no other intentions, just to talk--and the other girl got so drunk that she came over and kicked her in the face. So... it's really not becoming of females to beef up and get into fights and stuff. We're really vulnerable and a lot of guys, eventually, not only do they start taking advantage of that, but it was a really big turn-off too.

	   Not everyone will experience an impairment problem, but every time we make high-risk choices we increase our risk for problems. 
In the last unit, we looked at what research tells us about the risks related to drinking and driving. But there are other risks to consider, too. 
So, both high-risk drinking, and drugs people use to get high, can cause impairment problems in the Yellow Phase.

	   Sure, and that's not a surprise to most people. What may be a surprise is that even infrequent heavy use can also increase risk for certain health problems. <br />
So while some people think it's dangerous to drink every day, they may also think it's okay, or "safe" somehow, to drink heavily as long as it's only on weekends. And when people drink a large quantity very quickly, they increase their risk for alcohol overdose, which can include passing out, coma, perhaps even death. And unfortunately for people who recover from the episode, they may experience lingering and possibly permanent brain damage. This is particularly true if theiy're mixing drugs with the alcohol.

	  It's not unlike medication. Think about it: a prescription may call for a pill to be taken twice a day for a week. But, what if a person decides instead to take all 14 pills in one day?

	  Right, and the same principle applies to alcohol. Let's say I drink 2 drinks every day for seven days – that's 14 drinks, and it's within the 0-1-2-3 guidelines. But if I drink those 14 drinks in one night, it could be deadly.

	  When people drink a large quantity of alcohol quickly, there's a risk for alcohol overdose, which can lead to passing out, coma, seizures… even death. And people who survive an overdose can be left with permanent brain damage. These outcomes are even more likely if people take drugs in addition to drinking alcohol.

	   So what are some other examples of problems people might experience in the Yellow Phase? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        EJNA: 
        
	  There are many. For example, when people are making high-risk choices and having sex, they're less likely to use protection, and because of that, experience higher rates of unplanned pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

		 And we've known for some time that  some men, when intoxicated, become much more aggressive, both physically and sexually. Current research also tells us that women who drink five or more drinks, increase their own risk for being a victim of  sexual aggression by nine times; and increase their risk for being a victim of physical aggression by seven times. 
Now make no mistake about it--the women are still the victims here--but her risk may be not only a function of the man's high-risk choices, it's alsoa function of her own high-risk choices.

      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

		 <br />
		 And then coming back to the health problems--another example is, if we get intoxicated once or more in a week, we actually increase our risk for cardiovascular death by 2.4 times. So, what we learn from this is that when we make high-risk choices we're increasing our risk for both health and impairment problems in the Yellow Phase."
