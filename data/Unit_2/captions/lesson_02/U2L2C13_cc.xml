      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Now, people in the Yellow Phase make high-risk choices with alcohol, and sometimes experience hangovers. But what exactly IS a hangover?    </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: A hangover is when, the next day you feel kinda woozy, you have a big old headache, you may vomit... Most days, for me are a hangover.    </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: A hangover is one of the worst feelings in the world! </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Basically, you get wasted the night before, and you pass out in your bed, and you wake up the next morning with a ridiculous headache, and your body is completely crashed. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: You don't really do that much activity, and when you smell liquor you feel like you gotta throw up. It's not a good feeling.   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: I don't know what causes it, other than drinking too much, and you feel like crap in the morning!   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: It feels like crap. A hangover feels like crap. Plain and simple, there's no other way to say it, crap, crap, and crap again.   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: All kidding aside: A hangover is the collection of unpleasant effects that we experience when the body is trying to re-establish its balance after we've made high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Here are some common symptoms of having a hangover...  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Headaches all day, they can't even go outside without the light hurting their eyes--that type of stuff.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Dehydrated, dry mouth, wake up with cramps in your legs. Umm, nasuea... That's about it!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Dry mouth, splitting headache, dehydration. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: You might feel like you've still got a headache, a kind of cloudiness in your head--things are not quite clear. From what I remember, things like having a low tolerance for sound.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: Waking up, you're just parched--you need some water because you're so dehydrated. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: They're still drunk from the night before, still stumbling out of bed and they can't hold themselves up... or throwing up the morning after.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: We'll talk more about hangovers later in the program. But for now, just know that experiencing hangovers may happen in the Yellow Phase. Having a hangover is a sign that we've exceeded the 0-1-2-3 Guidelines.</p>
