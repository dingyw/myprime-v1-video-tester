	   Now, people in the Yellow Phase make high-risk choices with alcohol, and sometimes experience hangovers.  But what exactly IS a hangover?

	   A hangover is when, the next day you feel kinda woozy, you have a big old headache, you may vomit... Most days, for me are a hangover.

	   A hangover is one of the worst feelings in the world! Basically, you get wasted the night before, and you pass out in your bed, and you wake up the next morning with a ridiculous headache, and your body is completely crashed. You don't really do that much activity, and when you smell liquor you feel like you gotta throw up. It's not a good feeling.

	   I don't know what causes it, other than drinking too much, and you feel like crap in the morning!

	   It feels like crap. A hangover feels like crap. Plain and simple, there's no other way to say it, crap, crap, and crap again.

	   All kidding aside: A hangover is the collection of unpleasant effects that we experience when the body is trying to re-establish its balance after we’ve made high-risk choices. Here are some common symptoms of having a hangover…

	   Headaches all day, they can't even go outside without the light hurting their eyes--that type of stuff.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

	   Dehydrated, dry mouth, wake up with cramps in your legs. Umm, nasuea.. That's about it!
      </p>

	   Dry mouth, splitting headache, dehydration.
      </p>

	   You might feel like you've still got a headache, a kind of cloudiness in your head--things are not quite clear. From what I remember, things like having a low tolerance for sound.
      </p>

	   Waking up, you're just parched--you need some water because you're so dehydrated. They're still drunk from the night before, still stumbling out of bed and they can't hold themselves up... or throwing up the morning after.

	   We’ll talk more about hangovers later in the program. But for now, just know that experiencing hangovers may happen in the Yellow Phase. Having a hangover is a sign that we’ve exceeded the 0-1-2-3 Guidelines.
