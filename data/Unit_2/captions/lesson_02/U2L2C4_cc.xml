      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:05.75">ANTONIO: Once again, we have Frosty and Ejna here. This time, we're talking about the Yellow Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:06.00" dur="00:00:05.00">FROSTY: And up to this point, all of our discussion has been about the low-risk choices of the Green Phase.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: Once people consistantly start making high-risk choices, they move in to the Yellow Phase. So the Yellow Phase is the first phase of high-risk use.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:06.00">EJNA: So what's new and different about the Yellow Phase is that when people are drinking in this phase, they're typically making high-risk choices. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:04.00">FROSTY: In other words, exceeding the low-risk guidelines--the 0-1-2-3.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: So Frosty, what about drugs in the Yellow Phase? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: Research is pretty clear that any use of drugs is high-risk, so if I'm using drugs, I'm at least in the Yellow Phase, whether I'm drinking or not.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:11.00">EJNA: And if I do drink, there are usually two patterns of drinking. Some people drink very rapidly, and so they get intoxicated--and in fact, it's probably why they're doing that.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:05.00">EJNA: And then, other people space those drinks over time, and therefore they do not get intoxicated. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.00" dur="00:00:08.00">FROSTY: In either case, both patterns are high-risk because they exceed the low-risk guidelines, and increase risk for problems. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: Okay, now we're going to look at some experiences people may have in the Yellow Phase. Not everyone will experience all of them, but most of these experiences can occur with either pattern of drinking.</p>
