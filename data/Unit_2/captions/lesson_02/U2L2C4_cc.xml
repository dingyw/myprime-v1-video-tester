	   Once again, we have Frosty and Ejna here.  This time, we’re talking about the Yellow Phase. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty: </b>
        <br/>
	   Up until this point, we've been talking about people following low-risk choices in the Green Phase. Once the start making high-risk choices, they move to the Yellow Phase. The Yellow Phase is the first phase of high-risk use.
      </p>

        <b>Ejna: </b>

	   What’s new and different about the Yellow Phase is that when people are drinking in this phase, they're typically making high-risk choices.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty: </b>
        <br/>
	   In other words, exceeding the low-risk guidelines--the 0-1-2-3.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   So Frosty, what about drugs in the Yellow Phase?
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty: </b>
        <br/>
	   Research shows that  any use of drugs is high-risk, so if I'm using drugs, I'm at least in the Yellow Phase, whether I'm drinking or not. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ejna: </b>
        <br/>
	   And if I do drink, there are usually two patterns of drinking. Some people drink very rapidly, and so they get intoxicated--in fact, that's probably why they're doing that. And then, other people space those drinks over time, and therefore they do not get intoxicated. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty: </b>
        <br/>
	   In either case, both patterns are high-risk because they exceed the low-risk guidelines, and increase risk for problems.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
		 <b>Antonio:</b>
		 <br />
		 Okay, now we’re going to look at some experiences people may have in the Yellow Phase.  Not everyone will experience all of them, but most of these experiences can occur with either pattern of drinking.
