      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:13.75">NARRATOR: High-risk choices often lead to impairment, so our body adapts by raising our tolerance level. In fact, some increase in tolerance can occur after just one episode of drinking, and it can accumulate over time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: Remember, the higher our tolerance goes, the bigger the gap gets between physical and mental tolerance. This tricks us into thinking we can drink more, putting us at greater risk for impairment problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: There's another side to tolerance that we see in the Yellow Phase. As tolerance goes up, it takes more alcohol or drugs to get the same effect.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: So it is likely we will slowly increase the amount of alcohol or drugs we use in order to get the effect we are looking for. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: We may increase the amount that we use on any occasion, increase the frequency of making high-risk choices, or both.</p>
