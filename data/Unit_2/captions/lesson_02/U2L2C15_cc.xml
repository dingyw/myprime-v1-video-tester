      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Alcohol advertisers have done their homework. They've carefully researched the characteristics of people in each phase so they know how to successfully market to them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Now we'll go to Jean Kilbourne, to explore how messages are crafted for people in the Yellow Phase...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: In the Yellow Phase people are starting to use alcohol to add fun, excitement, and pleasure to their lives.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: The alcohol ads aimed at people in the Yellow Phase reflect these themes. These ads promise that their brands will:</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Shake up your night... Bring happiness... Be "liquid fun..."  Or even ... make you electric.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Of all the relationship promises made by advertisers, the most compelling is what alcohol will do for sexual and romantic relationships.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Beliefs that alcohol enhances sex are deeply engrained in public thinking and experience. Studies indicate that enhancement of sexual relations is one of the major motivating factors in young adults' use of alcohol. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: In fact, if a person has developed sexual comfort or skills while making high-risk choices, it may become impossible for that person to be comfortable sexually without engaging in high-risk drinking.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Both men and women are encouraged to use alcohol to "catch" a member of the opposite sex:</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: How to catch a gentleman... Catch of the day.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: The advertisers want us to believe that getting the right drink and having plenty of it on hand is very important. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: If you have the right drink, you don't even have to try ... the beautiful woman will come to you and write her cell phone number on your forehead.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: One ad builds on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition and reminds men that the rest of the year they have to go out looking for beautiful women ... and the right beer will help.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: But of course, if you don't want the girl, you can at least get the beer...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">(TV Commercial music playing) FIRST MAN: Come on!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN: Not now.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">SECOND MAN: Get up and dance with me!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN: Maybe later.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANNOUNCER: For the great taste that won't fill you up and never lets you down, make it a Bud Light.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: These fantasies are for the most part just that--fantasies--but they are powerful fantasies that sell a lot of alcohol.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: The beliefs expressed in these ads are so deeply held in our culture that they have become powerful influences on our drinking choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Research indicates that alcohol does little to increase sexual arousal.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: However, when people want to be sexually active, they often turn to alcohol to become less inhibited and more confident and to make it easier to say "yes" or "will you?"</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Unfortunately, the reduced inhibitions that we are seeking also reduce our judgment and self-protection. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: People who have sex after making high-risk drinking choices are much less likely to use protection, which leads to more sexually transmitted diseases and more unplanned pregnancies.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Most unfortunately, it also increases the likelihood of sexual assault. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: One survey indicated that a sizable subgroup of young men feel that women who get drunk have consented to sex--an attitude that invites acquaintance rape. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Other men feel that drinking gives them an excuse for violent behavior. Some ads dangerously condone this belief. Sometimes the body language is suggestive of violence.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: There is no question that alcohol in some cultures has been viewed for centuries as enhancing the pleasure of groups and individuals.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: But is high-risk drinking an aid to relationships ... or, in the long run, is it a detriment? Let's keep exploring these issues.</p>
