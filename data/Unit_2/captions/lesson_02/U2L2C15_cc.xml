	   Alcohol advertisers have done their homework. They've carefully researched the characteristics of people in each phase so they know how to successfully market  to them. 
Now we'll go to Jean Kilbourne, to explore how messages are crafted for people in the Yellow Phase...

		 In the Yellow Phase people are starting to use alcohol to add fun, excitement, and pleasure to their lives. The alcohol ads aimed at people in the Yellow Phase reflect these themes. These ads promise that their brands will:
Shake up your night… Bring happiness… Be "liquid fun…"  Or even … make you electric.
Of all the relationship promises made by advertisers, the most compelling is what alcohol will do for sexual and romantic relationships. Beliefs that alcohol enhances sex are deeply engrained in public thinking and experience. Studies indicate that enhancement of sexual relations is one of the major motivating factors in young adults' use of alcohol. In fact, if a person has developed sexual comfort or skills while making high-risk choices, it may become impossible for that person to be comfortable sexually without engaging in high-risk drinking.
Both men and women are encouraged to use alcohol to "catch" a member of the opposite sex:
How to catch a gentleman…  Catch of the day.
The advertisers want us to believe that getting the right drink and having plenty of it on hand is very important. If you have the right drink, you don't even have to try … the beautiful woman will come to you and write her cell phone number on your forehead.
One ad builds on the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition and reminds men that the rest of the year they have to go out looking for beautiful women … and the right beer will help.
But of course, if you don't want the girl, you can at least get the beer…

		 These fantasies are for the most part just that--fantasies--but they are powerful fantasies that sell a lot of alcohol. The beliefs expressed in these ads are so deeply held in our culture that they have become powerful influences on our drinking choices. Research indicates that alcohol does little to increase sexual arousal. However, when people want to be sexually active, they often turn to alcohol to become less inhibited and more confident and to make it easier to say "yes" or "will you?"  Unfortunately, the reduced inhibitions that we are seeking also reduce our judgment and self-protection. People who have sex after making high-risk drinking choices are much less likely to use protection, which leads to more sexually transmitted diseases and more unplanned pregnancies.
Most unfortunately, it also increases the likelihood of sexual assault. One survey indicated that a sizable subgroup of young men feel that women who get drunk have consented to sex--an attitude that invites acquaintance rape. Other men feel that drinking gives them an excuse for violent behavior. Some ads dangerously condone this belief. 
Sometimes the body language is suggestive of violence 
There is no question that alcohol in some cultures has been viewed for centuries as enhancing the pleasure of groups and individuals. But is high-risk drinking an aid to relationships … or, in the long run, is it a detriment? Let's keep exploring these issues.
