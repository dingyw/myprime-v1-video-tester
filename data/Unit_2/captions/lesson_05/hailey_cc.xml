	   Hailey White never knew how dramatically her life would change when she celebrated summer's end at a party with her best friends.

        <b>Mom:</b>
        <br/>
	   Hailey was always very outgoing, fun loving, everybody knew Hailey, everybody loved Hailey, and she had a lot of goals and accomplishments that she achieved. And that seemed to really give me as Mom a sense of she's doing the right thing, she's involved in the positive things that will help her in her decision making and making good choices.

        <br/>
	   When I graduated high school I enrolled at a technical college in Fondalack.  Second to last year there, I drank a lot.  Growing up in Burlen that's kind of what everybody did.  There's not much for people to do, no movie theater, shopping mall, so we partied and we drank.

	   I remember the summer of the accident, uh, we had been drinking a lot.  There was a group of 8 of us from high school that always had girls' night weekly.

	   Every summer before school started, Hailey and her friends would attend one last party, where drinking was always an element.

	   We had a car down the road a couple miles, so we just figured we'd just walk down the road and get it.  And uh, Hailey came over a hill I guess and hit me.  I don't know, I don't remember nothing after that.

	   And I think I hit the brakes and I swerved, but the next thing I knew my windshield smashed, and then I stopped and I just screamed, and I knew who it was I graduated with him.  And it was his 21st birthday that night.

	   With feelings of remorse, Hailey got a sober friend to drive her back to the scene, where she identified herself to the first police officer she saw.  She was made to perform a field sobriety test, and blew a 0.19 on the Breath-a-Lyzer.

	   Hailey was charged with intoxicated use of a vehicle, causing injury.  She was sentenced to 2 years probation and 60 days in jail, which she was allowed to serve under house arrest.  She was made to wear a bracelet on each ankle, one to monitor her location, and one to monitor whether she had any alcohol.

	   After being fitted for the bracelet, police officers accompanied Hailey home to remove all alcohol and firearms from her father's house.

	   The consequences of Hailey's conviction became clear over time.  She tried to continue with college, but because she couldn't drive or find reliable transportation, she had to drop out.  Because the accident made headlines in the local paper, she was afraid to go anywhere, feeling she would be recognized and rejected.

	   I mean it was in Burlen, Wisconsin, 5000 people, you've lived here since the day you were born, everybody knows you, your parents are teachers, um, it was just very unsettling.

        <b>Hailey:</b>

	   I didn't want to deal with it, I didn't want people to tell me that because I was having a hard enough time.  We started getting attorney letters in the mail.  I hired my attorney, who told me that I couldn't contact Randy.  I didn't know what was going on, I didn't know if he was dead or alive.  It was awful.

	   I had a concussion, so they thought I was going to be brain-damaged of some sort because of fatty tissues that went to my brain.  I have pins in my knee and my ankle.  When I got hit and the bone snapped and came right through the skin, so the only thing holding it there was muscle.
