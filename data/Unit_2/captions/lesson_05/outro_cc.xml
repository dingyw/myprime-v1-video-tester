      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Outcomes like these do not always happen, of course. But the risk is always there each time we make high-risk choices. These losses do not have to happen. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: These treasures do not have to be lost. No one has the power to protect these treasures once we make high-risk choices. But each of us does have the power to protect. It is the power of our low-risk choices. </p>
