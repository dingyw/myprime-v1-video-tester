	   At this point I’m going to ask you to answer some questions about what you’ve just seen.  Some of them might seem difficult, because we’re not accustomed to looking closely at our own high-risk choices and their effects on others. So take as much time as you need.
I encourage you to answer these questions honestly. This can help you look at the real but hidden costs of high-risk choices in your life. There are no right or wrong answers.
