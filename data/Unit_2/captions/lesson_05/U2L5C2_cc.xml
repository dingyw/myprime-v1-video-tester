      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:12.75">ANTONIO: Now we're going to watch something to make the risks more real. We'll hear from people who have lost something treasured as a result of alcohol or drug use. These are not actors; they are real people.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: If you feel uncomfortable as you listen to their stories, you're not alone. But, it is important to take this opportunity to look at the costs of high-risk choices. No one wants to experience these kinds of losses.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: And no one of thinks it will happen to them... but then, none of these people did either.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: We ask that you commit at least one hour to this section of the program. It will take approximately that long for you to view the stories, and answer some questions afterward.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: You'll get the most out of this lesson if you watch the videos and complete the reflection questions together in one sitting, so make sure you have an uninterrupted block of time before you begin.</p>
