      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: There are times when loss is not the result of a single high-risk choice. Sometimes loss can only be recognized after a lifetime of high-risk choices. Sometimes, that loss is devastating.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: When I was a child, I always felt like I was on the outside looking in. I never felt like I connected with anybody. I got introduced to marijuana at the age of 11.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: By the time I was in 7th grade, I had progressed to stimulants, downers, LSD, cocaine...I really robbed myself of being a kid.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Dave's use of drugs and alcohol continued throughout his high school years. He was admitted to a treatment center but was only out 3 days when he relapsed and was involved in an alcohol-related crash.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Dave and three of his friends ended up in the hospital.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I remember the police officer coming in and saying, well I'm not going to issue any citations because I think they learned their lesson. And, you know for me that was just a you know, well there's no consequences. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: He followed a path of high risk choice for the next 20 years. Along the way, he alienated and abused the trust of everyone who cared about him, which fueled his pain and resentment.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: I hated for the phone to ring, I hated for people to come up to the door. I was ashamed to say that he was my son.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MICHELLE: It's a hard thing to just shut a door on him. But I knew that if I didn't, it was going to be harmful to myself and my children, and I couldn't allow that.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In an attempt to escape what his life had become, Dave moved from Iowa to Lake Tahoe when he was 21 years old.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: That was when I first got introduced to crystal meth.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: Took six thousand dollars that I had saved and I bought a rock of crystal meth the size of a softball and I had actually spent six days in a coma from that experience, about two and a half weeks in intensive care,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">I was on life support, and another 3 weeks in the hospital after that.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: I didn't know that he had OD'ed out there and had been in a hospital for 6 days. I didn't know that.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: And I can remember getting all my senses together and realizing what had happened and where I was. The first thing that went through my head was, man I need to get high.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: There was no, God, you know I almost killed myself, it was man I need to get high.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: After this incident, Dave moved back home to Iowa.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I met another girl, she ended up getting pregnant. You know we had made plans to get married and you know do all this stuff. And about this time I started finding crystal meth again.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: And you know her and I were doing it. I remember getting the phone call, she was really crying uncontrollably, hysterically, and told me that the baby had died and that they were going to induce labor.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I remember sitting in this chair and holding him and...I can remember kissing him and telling him you got to wake up so we can go home, and he just never woke up you know.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Although Dave's losses were progressive, he continued to use drugs and alcohol at an even more alarming rate.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I had no control over anything that I did anymore.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: There were times I didn't know where he was. Might be gone for days and I worried about him the whole time, sick to my stomach. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: Then I turned 30 and I met Shayla. Once again it was...I met her at a drug house. She ended up getting pregnant. And the whole time she was pregnant we both used. And in June of 2003 my son Davidson was born.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Davidson was taken by the department of human services because of his parents' drug abuse and domestic violence.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: Another baby was gone, you know. And at that point was pretty much the end for me caring about anything.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Dave got an evaluation at an alcohol and drug dependency service program, and was put on the waiting list for a bed. But he missed his intake date because he was high.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: After losing the opportunity to go to treatment and get his son back, Dave tried to commit suicide.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I shot up about a gram and a half of meth, and I had probably 70 or 80 pills, and I threw them in my mouth and chewed them up and swallowed them. And then I went back and laid in my bed and just waited to die.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: Horrible. His eyes were rolled back in his head, and he was foaming at the mouth.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Paramedics rushed Dave's lifeless body to the emergency room. On Christmas Eve, Dave was released to his mother. Within 3 hours, he was shooting up heroin and did nothing to change his drug use.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I was getting the visits with Davidson, and Shayla was pregnant again. I would go to the visits with Davidson and I would go there high.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: I took that picture, and then after developing it I'm like, God, I didn't realize he looked that bad.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Over the next six months, Dave spiraled even further out of control. He was arrested four times, the final charge for manufacturing methamphetamine. If convicted, he faced up to 60 years in prison.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I had a court-appointed attorney and I remember him telling me that we've got a plea deal and I was like oh, yeah, what's that and he was like, 35 years, and he said I think you should take it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I never surrendered to the addiction but I did surrender to the fact that I was going to go to prison for a long time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In the same month, Dave's son Griffin was born.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: He was born addicted. I never got to see him for the first 3 or 4 months that he was alive.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: He was born with some issues, I mean he was born shaking, um a lot of overstimulation issues. When you would feed him he couldn't keep eye contact with you, he'd look away.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Des Moines County began a drug diversion program that included treatment in lieu of prison. In order to get in, Dave had to plead guilty. Just before entering, he returned to a familiar spot to get high one more time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I never ever thought that I'd be standing here getting ready to shoot up crystal meth, getting ready to go into a treatment center for the fourth time, with prison time hanging over my head. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: Once I got into the meth and stuff I ended up losing the house and a truck that I'd bought, the only new vehicle I'd ever owned in my life.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MARK: There was numerous years of employment that he cannot fall back on. At his age he's trying to think far enough ahead how he can survive past working years where he lost basically probably 25 years of employment.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAVE: I lost a lot of friends and relationships due to my addiction and due to their addiction too you know. I lost a couple kids along the way. A lot of self-respect and freedom and stuff for myself. Some of that stuff will never ever get back.</p>
