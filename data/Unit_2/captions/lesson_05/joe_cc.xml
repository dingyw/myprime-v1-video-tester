      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I was told that I was no good, a nobody, you're insecure, you'll never amount to anything, had doors shut in my face, friends, family didn't even want to deal with you.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I been through it all. I started drinking alcohol in 1986. Started out with Boone's Farm 20/20, Mad Dog. And it led from there and I started smoking marijuana, and that led from there and I started doing cocaine. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: And that led from there to crack cocaine. And when I got on crack cocaine, that's when the trauma started in my life. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ESOPH: Joe all the sudden started looking strangely in the eyes first, and his way of doing things was so totally different than the way it used to be. And at that time I would question him and of course he was always to be in denial.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: And one lie would bring on another lie and another lie would bring on another lie. And you would keep on lying till you didn't know how to do nothing but lie. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: The first thing crack cocaine done was cause major major problems in my marriage, in my home with my kids, on my jobs. I would do crack before I'd go to work, sometimes didn't ever make it to work. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: But he would not tell me he had a problem, he'd tell me no ma'am, everything is all right. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Eventually Joe's dishonesty caught up with him. He served time for felony burglary, which took a heavy emotional toll on his family. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: The baby would just go, she would be alright in the day, and then about time for him to come home in the evening she would start crying, she would say "I want my Daddy."  And that would kill me. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: When Joe got out of jail he lost his job. He entered treatment briefly, but wasn't ready to take an honest look at his decisions. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I had it licked I thought, that didn't last too long. I said one little hit won't hurt. So I went back out the second time on a wild spree of crack cocaine.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: My key wouldn't fit in the lock on my door anymore. My wife had just had enough. And it had gotten so bad in my family that I had to stay with my mother-in-law. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: He got to the place the drug had him he just didn't care didn't care about himself. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: As Joe's drug use increased, so did his dishonesty. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I stole from my wife, stole her vehicle, stole her cars, stole her money. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: And each time she would be saying, Ma I'm going to the police, Ma I'm going to do that, I'd say uh-uh. Don't pour water on a drowning man. That ain't him, I said he's sick.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I stole from my kids. That's how the disease crack cocaine had affected me. Took their piggy bank. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ESOPH: That's just how bad his addiction had got, until he you know, if he could have taken money from his own family. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: Me and my family had planned a Disney World trip with the Girl Scouts, because I was a chaperone for the Girl Scouts.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: When I got my money out of the bank to go on the trip, that Thursday evening, I stopped by and I hit some crack cocaine, and when I hit that crack cocaine, I missed my 4-day trip with my family, and I went on a 4-day spree.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The crime and dishonesty in Joe's life due to drugs and alcohol led him to his lowest point. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: He went and moved something out of my church. That was the embarassingest thing I've ever seen. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I breaked into Shaves AME Church and I went to jail for the second time, again, for burglary, second degree burglary. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: Oh, that really hurt me, because I had put my trust in him. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Joe was arrested and spent time in jail for the burglary, but the church decided not to press charges. Although the church forgave Joe, his family and friends had a harder time doing so. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I hurt a lot of people, not only my immediate family, my wife and my children, but my brothers, my sisters, a lot of friends you know didn't want to have anything to do with me, because I was a compulsive liar, I was a compulsive beggar. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ESOPH: So it took a great part of my love from him away from me but you know, I still didn't change the way I feel about him because I realize you know, it could have been the other way, it could have been me. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: When I came out of the jail I told God that I was tired of living the way I was living.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: There was another incident that added to Joe's final decision to change his situation. His nephew, also a crack addict who Joe used with, was responsible for a shocking act, and ultimately paid the price.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: He got arrested for hitting my mother which would have been his grandmother in the head with a hammer and it did some serious damage, so he got arrested and the inmates had beat him up that Friday night.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: But the sad part about it, we got a call that Sunday morning that said that he hung himself in the Florence County Detention Center.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: Drugs will take your bank account from a million dollars to zero. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: I just lost so many things, houses, due to my addiction. Like I said I lost vehicles, I lost more jobs than I can count on two hands.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MOM: He lose his wife. He lose his children.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ESOPH: He felt like he lost his trust as a brother and what he lost in me, because he knew that we had each other back no matter what before all this happened. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JOE: Knowing the fact that I'd break into a church, I just, how low more could I have done? I had to get honest with Joe, and I had to quit blaming everybody for my addictions and my excuses.</p>
