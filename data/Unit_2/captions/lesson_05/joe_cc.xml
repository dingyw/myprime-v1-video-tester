        <b>Joe: </b>
        <br/>
	   I was told that I was no good, a nobody, you're insecure, you'll never amount to anything, had doors shut in my face, friends, family didn't even want to deal with you. I been through it all. I started drinking alcohol in 1986. Started out with Boone's Farm 20/20, Mad Dog. And it led from there and I started smoking marijuana, and that led from there and I started doing cocaine. And that led from there to crack cocaine. And when I got on crack cocaine, that's when the trauma started in my life.

	   Joe all the sudden started looking strangely in the eyes first, and his way of doing  things was so totally different than the way it used to be. And at that time I would question him and of course he was always to be in denial.  
      </p>

	   And one lie would bring on another lie and another lie would bring on another lie. And you would keep on lying till you didn't know how to do nothing but lie.

	   The first thing crack cocaine done was cause major major problems in my marriage, in my home with my kids, on my jobs. I would do crack before I'd go to work, sometimes didn't ever make it to work.

	   Eventually Joe's dishonesty caught up with him. He served time for felony burglary, which took a heavy emotional toll on his family.

	   When Joe got out of jail he lost his job. He entered treatment briefly, but wasn't ready to take an honest look at his decisions.

	   I had it licked I thought, that didn't last too long. I said one little hit won't hurt. So I went back out the second time on a wild spree of crack cocaine. My key wouldn't fit in the lock on my door anymore. My wife had just had enough. And it had gotten so bad in my family that I had to stay with my mother-in-law.

	   Me and my family had planned a Disney World trip with the Girl Scouts, because I was a chaperone for the Girl Scouts. When I got my money out of the bank to go on the trip, that Thursday evening, I stopped by and I hit some crack cocaine, and when I hit that crack cocaine, I missed my 4-day trip with my family, and I went on a 4-day spree.

	   Joe was arrested and spent time in jail for the burglary, but the church decided not to press charges. Although the church forgave Joe, his family and friends had a harder time doing so.

	   I hurt a lot of people, not only my immediate family, my wife and my children, but my brothers, my sisters, a lot of friends you know didn't want to have anything to do with me, because I was a compulsive liar, I was a compulsive beggar.

	   There was another incident that added to Joe's final decision to change his situation. His nephew, also a crack addict who Joe used with, was responsible for a shocking act, and ultimately paid the price.

	   He got arrested for hitting my mother which would have been his grandmother in the head with a hammer and it did some serious damage, so he got arrested and the inmates had beat him up that Friday night. But the sad part about it, we got a call that Sunday morning that said that he hung himself in the Florence County Detention Center.
