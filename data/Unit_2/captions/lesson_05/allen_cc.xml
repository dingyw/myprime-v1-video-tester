      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: When I was young I knew that something was missing in me, I was looking for something to fix me so I started drinking when I was 15.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I drank through high school, I found friends that liked to do what I did. We'd skip class, smoke dope, and drink, and, I just thought it was going to be good forever. I thought it was going to be fun forever.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I had ambitions, I wanted to work on cars, and I still did that but my priorities changed. I had to start planning everything around a drink. My plans sort of got sidetracked. And the car wreck, the car wreck really did this. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: It was a rainy day. Allen had been drinking. On his way to a friend's, he lost control of his vehicle, crossed the median, and slammed into an oncoming car.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The gas tank blew up, trapping Allen in the burning car for five minutes. The crash left Allen blind, and with limited use of his hands. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I should have died right there because I had inhaled so much flame and soot and stuff that my throat had literally constricted shut. And there just happened to be a doctor in the traffic jam. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: A couple of guys dragged me out of the car and the doctor did a tracheotomy right on the side of the road there. He cut my windpipe open and put the jacket of a ballpoint pen in there so I could breathe.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: He spent the next 14 months in the hospital, enduring excruciating burn treatments, and numerous other surgeries.    </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: Because I had a hepatitis D infection they'd take me down to the physical therapy tank and they'd put bleach in the water to try to clear that up, and they'd put you in the tank and it was just like having acid poured on your skin.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: It was 14 months of legalized torture basically, and finally I got out of there. I got healed and went home and was facing another ten years of reconstructive surgery as they tried to patch me together a little bit.`</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: For ten years, Allen managed to control his addictions. But an undercurrent of boredom, panic and depression led him back to his high-risk behaviors.    </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I was liking the pain pills, I was liking the opiates. Anything that gave me that buzz, I liked.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: The problem with those is that as your tolerance goes up you need more and more to get that feeling of euphoria and when I was 29 or 30 I just started drinking again and I was still enjoying it,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">and you know I got that feeling of euphoria, and I thought to myself, why haven't you been doing this all along?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: So I started drinking again and I was living in the upstairs of my parents' house, going nowhere, drinking every night, and then I'd wake up the next day so sick I could not drink, I literally could not hold a beer down, hold a drink down.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: And I'd just lie around in bed all day. That's what I'd been doing my whole life is trying to avoid reality.</p>
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Throughout his life, Allen's choices led to losses of an unimaginable nature.</p> 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: Well the biggest loss of course was the loss of my eyesight. That changes everything, that adds a degree of difficulty to living.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: You can't really explain it exactly, it's just that you have to think ahead on everything. It used to fill me with a sense of panic, like I just, I can't do that I know I can't do that, so I'm not even going to try. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I still have ambitions and dreams it's just that the loss of eyesight is such a, creates such a huge obstacle, it just changes the whole equation. When I was drinking I really didn't have any freedom.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I was completely antisocial, I didn't want to be around people, they got on my nerves, and</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">I wanted to be left alone so I could drink but then when I'd reach a certain point I'd wonder why I felt so lonely, because I was you know, I wanted people to get away from me but then when they did I wondered why I was so alone.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I had two or three other incidences where I could have easily have probably gotten killed or have killed somebody else.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: It makes me shudder when I think of that, how I had no regard for anybody else's safety and you know, so it was just a numbers game.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: I was playing roulette and it caught up with me. And I lost a lot of time, I lost a lot of time to drinking, I just wasted you know, all that time getting drunk and not going anywhere, and telling myself it would be different tomorrow.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALLEN: Well the biggest loss of course was the loss of my eyesight. That changes everything, that adds a degree of difficulty to living. You can't really explain it exactly, it's just that you have to think ahead on everything.</p>
