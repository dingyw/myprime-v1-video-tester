	   I've driven impaired before, and I'm really lucky that I've never caused anything like that.

	   I know getting a DUI doesn't seem very lucky, but knowing what can happen, I think it really was. Maybe next time I won't be so lucky.

	   I don't even drive drunk, and I always assumed that when I drive stoned, it wasn't even close to being as dangerous, especially when I try real hard.

	   I've driven drunk hundreds of times... at this point I just tell myself to pull it together... But I guess I figured I could get away with it.

	   I guess I thought because of my high tolerance I was safe, I was fine to drive. My friends would call me Superman 'cause I would always drive them home, but now I realize I was impaired.

	   The first person that comes to mind is my mom. After watching that video, I could just imagine calling my mom from jail and telling her what I did, or even worse, someone else makes the call and tells her that I'm dead. I can see the look on her face and that's something I never wanna have happen.

	   Man, I could really picture my dad just going off on me, and I don't wanna go down that road. I jut think it's not worth it in any regard. It's better to be safe than sorry.

	   I just realized.. what if the person that I hit and accidentally killed turned out to be my kid brother--he was in the other car. It's just stupid, there's no point, there's no reason to get that drunk and get behind the wheel.

	   I was recently blessed with a little girl. Her name is Sophie. She's my whole world. If I did something as stupid as that, just took a risk on a couple of beers and went out in a car 'cause I was too prideful to get a ride, or too stupid to stay in. And kill somebody, or worse get killed and not be there for her. I don't know... It's not something... It's not something I even wanna think about really. I don't wanna plan on that.

	   I just wanna remember the cost of my high-risk choices. I think that's the best thing I can take away from this.

	   I want to remember low-risk choices. It's one thing to not wanna do something stupid, but you need to know what your low-risk choices are.

	   I'm just gonna remember how quickly life can change. That's what I'm gonna be thinking about next time I'm gonna make a high-risk choice.

	   This experience of watching the videos, responding to the processing questions, and also seeing how others respond to the questions can be quite powerful for people.  So now, take a few moments to reflect.
