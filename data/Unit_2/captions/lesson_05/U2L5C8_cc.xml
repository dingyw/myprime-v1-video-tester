      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 1: Man, I'd feel awful... I think anyone would.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: God, I'd be devastated.    </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 3: I don't even wanna imagine what that would feel like.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: I've driven impaired before, and I'm really lucky that I've never caused anything like that.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: I guess that it can just take one bad night and your whole life can be changed forever.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 1: Man, I just don't wanna be responsible for causing this kind of pain for someone else, all 'cause my dumb choices.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 3: I guess it's a ripple effect, you think you're the only one affected by your choices, but it can affect everyone.   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: I know getting a DUI doesn't seem very lucky, but knowing what can happen, I think it really was. Maybe next time I won't be so lucky.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 1: I don't even drive drunk, and I always assumed that when I drive stoned, it wasn't even close to being as dangerous, especially when I try real hard.   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 3: I've driven drunk hundreds of times... at this point I just tell myself to pull it together... But I guess I figured I could get away with it.   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: I guess I thought because of my high tolerance I was safe, I was fine to drive. My friends would call me Superman 'cause I would always drive them home, but now I realize I was impaired. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: Yeah, you know, I'd say like, "just this one time is okay," or "it's only a few miles away," or "there's nobody else on the road." </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 3: The first person that comes to mind is my mom. After watching that video, I could just imagine calling my mom from jail and telling her what I did, or even worse, someone else makes the call and tells her that I'm dead. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 3: I can see the look on her face and that's something I never wanna have happen. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 1: Man, I could really picture my dad just going off on me, and I don't wanna go down that road. I jut think it's not worth it in any regard. It's better to be safe than sorry. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: I just realized.. what if the person that I hit and accidentally killed turned out to be my kid brother--he was in the other car.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: It's just stupid, there's no point, there's no reason to get that drunk and get behind the wheel. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: I was recently blessed with a little girl. Her name is Sophie. She's my whole world.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: If I did something as stupid as that, just took a risk on a couple of beers and went out in a car 'cause I was too prideful to get a ride, or too stupid to stay in. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: And kill somebody, or worse get killed and not be there for her. I don't know... It's not something... It's not something I even wanna think about really. I don't wanna plan on that.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 1: I just wanna remember the cost of my high-risk choices. I think that's the best thing I can take away from this. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 2: I wanna remember that while I can't change my biology, I can at least change my high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: I want to remember low-risk choices. It's one thing to not wanna do something stupid, but you need to know what your low-risk choices are. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ONLINE USER 4: I'm just gonna remember how quickly life can change. That's what I'm gonna be thinking about next time I'm gonna make a high-risk choice.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: This experience of watching the videos, responding to the processing questions, and also seeing how others respond to the questions can be quite powerful for people. So now, take a few moments to reflect. </p>
