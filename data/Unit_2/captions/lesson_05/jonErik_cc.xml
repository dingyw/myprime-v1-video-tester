      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The cost of high-risk choices can be devastating to those who have made them. But there are others who suffer unimaginable loss through no choice of their own.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BENTON: I first met Jon-Erik in 1991, I believe it was. If I'm not mistaken Jon-Erik was probably 7 or 8 years old at that time. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BENTON: He was a typical little boy, he loved to get into things and loved to ask a million questions, but I just remember Jon-Erik just being a bright bubbly young child with a good future ahead of him.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: While I was in my senior year of high school, I had a black Firebird. Oh boy, it was a chick magnet.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: I used to ride around in that thing with my girlfriend and she was the one driving her vehicle that I was in when we were hit head-on by a drunk driver who was in the wrong lane. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: The deputy sheriff came to my door around 11, he was on a cell phone, wanted to know if I was Jon-Erik's father.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: I said yes I am, he said Jon-Erik's been in a wreck, and they're going to helicopter him to Greenville, to Greenville Memorial Hospital. And wanted me to get ready and go there.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Jon-Erik sustained a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury from the wreck. It put him in the hospital for 10 months, 7 of them in a coma.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: Just imagine, yourself lying in a hospital bed with tubes inside of your stomach to feed you and an air pipe running to your throat because you can't breathe through your injured mouth and nose. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: Imagine laying there, imagine laying there for over 7 months, 7 months. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BENTON: It really broke my heart, it was hard. Twenty seconds can take you from a promising future to a possibility of not even being here.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The driver of the other car was killed in the crash. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: He had a long history of driving offenses, driving under the influence, and he ended up at one of the bars at 5 in the afternoon until around ten o'clock that night, which caused him to be highly impaired, and to hit my car my son was riding in head-on.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: While still in a coma, Jon-Erik was moved to a rehabilitation hospital, where he went through intense physical therapy. One of the lifelong effects of his injuries is ataxia, a loss of balance and full control of his limbs. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: I still cannot walk independently besides I mean, the walker, I use a walker.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Jon-Erik also suffers from short-term memory loss.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: You tell me your name and a few seconds later I'll forget who you are. It's just destroyed my uh, my future for now. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Jon-Erik's mother passed away when he was a child, so Haskell has been his primary caretaker since the crash.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: Someone has to maintain his daily medicine, medication, prepare his food for him in most cases. He probably will never be able to live on his own ever again. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Before the crash, Jon-Erik was living the life of a normal teenager. He was an athlete, an exceptional student, and awarded a scholarship at the University of South Carolina.
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The crash happened nine days before he was to start school.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: And he'd love to go back to school, to college, and probably never be able to go. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: I probably to tell the truth I wouldn't even be able to remember my teacher's name. I mean, that's how bad this has affected me, has affected my whole life and it's affected my whole family. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: The hardest thing I had to do was cancel his classes at the school because I wanted him to get more education than I had, I was not able to go to college, and I didn't go to college, and he was, made the grades in school to go. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: There were over a million dollars in hospital bills, and the drunk driver had no liability insurance. But because Jon-Erik was 18 at the time, he was deemed responsible for the debt.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: Otherwise I would've had to declare bankruptcy, because I would've been responsible for the bills.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: My father had to miss work while coming to visit me in my hospital. I mean he had to leave and put a sign on the door saying you know, be back later, going to go visit my son dying in the hospital.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: While at the rehab hospital, Jon-Erik met Roland Hill, a fellow patient who would become a close friend. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROLAND: I really had a heart for Jon-Erik when I saw, man, how far can he get? There's no telling what he could have been. He'd run track, he was smart enough to graduate early.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROLAND: He was aspiring to become a psychiatrist. He had a potential of so much. But that wreck stopped it. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">BENTON: This world is definitely at a loss, because I just believe he was going to do things that would change people's lives.     </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROLAND: One thing that doesn't show a lot, Jon-Erik's had to battle depression.   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: I don't have a girlfriend because, instead of, you know, I was lying in a coma, now I haven't really seen her in, it's been a long time.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: She don't come around no more, like the song says, "She don't come around..."  It's been pretty hard, pretty rough for me.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">DAD: I lost the possibility probably of grandkids in the future. But he lost the possibility of having kids himself, a wife.  </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROLAND: He and I talk about getting along with girls a lot of times. He seems to be interested in what it's like to be married. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JON-ERIK: My friend Roland, he says they'll have some new advances in medical research, and they'll have something out that will help my memory. I hope that's true, if not then I don't know what I'm going to do the rest of my life. </p>
