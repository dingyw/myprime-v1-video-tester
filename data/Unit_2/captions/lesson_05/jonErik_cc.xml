	   The cost of high-risk choices can be devastating to those who have made them. But there are others who suffer unimaginable loss through no choice of their own.

	   I first met Jon-Erik in 1991, I believe it was. If I'm not mistaken Jon-Erik was probably 7 or 8 years old at that time. He was a typical little boy, he loved to get into things and loved to ask a million questions, but I just remember Jon-Erik just being a bright bubbly young child with a good future ahead of him.

	   While I was in my senior year of high school, I had a black Firebird. Oh boy, it was a chick magnet. I used to ride around in that thing with my girlfriend and she was the one driving her vehicle that I was in when we were hit head-on by a drunk driver who was in the wrong lane.

	   The deputy sheriff came to my door around 11, he was on a cell phone, wanted to know if I was Jon-Erik's father. I said yes I am, he said Jon-Erik's been in a wreck, and they're going to helicopter him to Greenville, to Greenville Memorial Hospital. And wanted me to get ready and go there.

	   Jon-Erik sustained a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury from the wreck. It put him in the hospital for 10 months, 7 of them in a coma.

	   He had a long history of driving offenses, driving under the influence, and he ended up at one of the bars at 5 in the afternoon until around ten o'clock that night, which caused him to be highly impaired, and to hit my car my son was riding in head-on.

	   While still in a coma, Jon-Erik was moved to a rehabilitation hospital, where he went through intense physical therapy. One of the lifelong effects of his injuries is ataxia, a loss of balance and full control of his limbs.

	   Before the crash, Jon-Erik was living the life of a normal teenager. He was an athlete, an exceptional student, and awarded a scholarship at the University of South Carolina. The crash happened nine days before he was to start school.

	   The hardest thing I had to do was cancel his classes at the school because I wanted him to get more education than I had, I was not able to go to college, and I didn't go to college, and he was, made the grades in school to go.

	   There were over a million dollars in hospital bills, and the drunk driver had no liability insurance. But because Jon-Erik was 18 at the time, he was deemed responsible for the debt.

	   I really had a heart for Jon-Erik when I saw, man, how far can he get?  There's no telling what he could have been. He'd run track, he was smart enough to graduate early. He was aspiring to become a psychiatrist. He had a potential of so much. But that wreck stopped it.

	   I don't have a girlfriend because, instead of, you know, I was lying in a coma, now I haven't really seen her in, it's been a long time. She don't come around no more, like the song says, "She don't come around..."  It's been pretty hard, pretty rough for me.
