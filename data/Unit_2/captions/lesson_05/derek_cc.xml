	   A single choice. A deceptively normal decision. A split second. Shattering consequences…
This story involves two families hundreds of miles apart and the indescribable riptide of a single choice on all of their lives. Both families have been touched by a tragedy, but each in its own way…
In suburban Atlanta, the Jordens struggle to return to something close to normal.

He’d already expressed an interest in theater, but the world was his oyster.

So, the day of the accident I was working as a valet parker, parking cars at the golf course. …A couple beers on the golf course, that just seemed to be part of the ritual, … I wasn’t even of legal drinking age at this time and we went out to this steak house and had dinner and more beers.

I guess the last thing I remember was seeing, this was south Florida where they got these long straight road and you can see green lights all the way down them, or traffic lights anyway, sometimes they’re red. But they were green as far as I could see and that’s kinda the last vision I remember having. I guess somewhere along the way one of em must have turned red.

	   Some of the things are hard to put into words…forever I’ll have this label of drunk driver—drunk driver killer—not even just that I got a DUI but a DUI manslaughter. That’s just horrendous. 
We don’t have the time to always look through and always find the true character. So I think that the biggest loss, it’s kind of abstract, kind of intangibles or something. You won’t really ever know some of the biggest losses, your personal losses, what doors might have opened, what paths might have been available that are now overgrown, that are now shut down, gates closed, not gonna happen. The friendships, the relationships that might have blossomed.…But man just that one night, man just that one night!  All the pain, the ripple effect it’s sent out.
A new idea has come up to where a ripple could’ve gone. These are things that you won’t ever see, couldn’t ever really know, … but there’s other ways and just the little waves of that ripple have crept into people’s lives and just passed on and on. …

	   I know when he wakes up every morning, there's something he loses every morning before he even gets up and gets going. [Crying a little]. He's lost out on probably one of the biggest thing was his good name--he was Derrick Jorden, gone to high school, done well, gone on to college.
The main thing is I've lost "I can be your big brother, I can be there. I've gone down the road sooner that you've gone down. This is what you can do and what you shouldn't do."  He's in a place where I haven't been and I don't know what it's like.
…  It's all the little stuff you start picking up on and that's one of the biggest treasures that Derrick's not had is being able to see all those little things all the time.

	   The last 4 years you talk about your early 20s are some of the best years of your life, you’re getting all this freedom and responsibility. ….Those are things that he’ll never be able to come back and experience. …  I’m getting married in June and this kid who without question should be my best man unfortunately won’t be able to be there for that.

	   There’s going to be a beautiful photo album and a ton of pictures and I won’t be in any one of them. And those pictures will be there forever. Those pictures will be there as long as he’s on the earth and probably beyond that, and I won’t be, I will never be in his wedding album. I’ll never be in my brother’s either, and the pictures from my mother’s 50th birthday, or the pictures from my sister’s graduation and the big party they had at the house. …  The only pictures that I’ve been in in the past 4 years is Polaroids. Plain Polaroids of me standing in this blue outfit, with my mom or my sister or my brothers… They’re not that cool.
… it took me a while to ever say, I was drinking and driving and I killed somebody. It took me a while to say that b/c I didn’t want the blame, and to assume the responsibility of taking another person’s life is massive and something that I don’t think anybody that hasn’t done could understand.
