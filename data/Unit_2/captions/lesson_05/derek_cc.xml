      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">NARRATOR: This story involves two families hundreds of miles apart and the indescribable riptide of a single choice on all of their lives.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: In suburban Atlanta, the Jordens struggle to return to something close to normal.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:08.00">CARL: One of the things we've tried to explain to our children is it's up to them what they choose to do with their lives.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:04.00">KATHIE: ...we had four children and our four children were each other's best friends, they had to be.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:10.00">BRADLEY: We're military family, moved around a lot, didn't keep a lot of the same friends so through that always gravitated toward each other...</p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:07.00">LISA: Our family has always been extremely close, and would do anything for anybody in a heartbeat. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:06.00">KYLE: ... we went to the same high school. On the swim team together and had a lot of good times together.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:11.00">KYLE: ...he had gone off to school and I was finishing up my high school, looking to go off to college and follow him down to FL. That all changed...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:10.00">LISA: July 25, that was one day I'll never forget. ...My mom woke me up and she said Derrick is...and when she said that my heart drops...</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:06.00">KATHIE: ...This was someplace we'd never been, never had any experience with, we didn't know what to do, what not to do.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:08.00">KYLE: This was going to be something that for the rest of our lives would change every aspect of what we do and who we are.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.00" dur="00:00:10.00">DERRICK: One thing that bothers me is how other people in society might look at my family knowing what I did.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:34.00" dur="00:00:07.00">DERRICK: My name is Derrick Jorden. I'm an inmate in the FL Dept of Corrections, DC number W26096.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:41.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DERRICK: ...Here for DUI manslaughter. ...I was 20 years old at the time.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.00" dur="00:00:15.00">DERRICK: I graduated high school in 1999 and moved to south Florida and enrolled in college there. The social life, the party scene there wasn't mom and dad there to tell me not to do it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:01.00" dur="00:00:04.00">DERRICK: ...I handled it responsibly most times...</p>
      <p begin="00:02:05.00" dur="00:00:06.00">DERRICK: The day of the accident I was working at a valet... I was parking cars at the golf course.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:11.00" dur="00:00:07.00">DERRICK: Of course when I go out with those guys playing golf, a couple beers on the golf course just seemed to be a part of the ritual, part of the tradition.</p> 	  
	  <p begin="00:02:18.00" dur="00:00:09.00">DERRICK: ...I wasn't even of legal drinking age at this time and we went out to this steak house and had dinner and more beers.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:27.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: It was "two-dollar pitcher night" at a local bar. Derrick paid a bouncer to let him in, and he drank there until 2AM.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:35.00" dur="00:00:09.00">DERRICK: I told them I was alright and I had only had a few beers and that I didn't need a ride home... so I got in the car and buckled up. Turned on the lights and took off. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:44.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DERRICK: This was south Florida where they got these long straight road and you can see green lights all the way down them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:49.00" dur="00:00:11.00">DERRICK: They were green as far as I could see and that's kinda the last vision I remember having. I guess somewhere along the way one of em must have turned red.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:00.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: Derrick's car traveling car at over 80 miles per hour slammed into another vehicle neirly cutting it in half</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:07.00" dur="00:00:03.00">NARRATOR: Flames pierced the night as he escaped his burning car.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:10.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DERRICK: ...when I first heard that somebody died, it –that was a shock, that was a shock.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:15.00" dur="00:00:05.00">KYLE: Derrick made a mistake. It was Derrick's choice...</p>
      <p begin="00:03:20.00" dur="00:00:04.00">DERRICK: We all know it's wrong and but who'd have ever thought it would have happened to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:24.00" dur="00:00:07.00">CARL: Obviously, it's nothing you ever plan for or think about, it always happens to someone else.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:31.00" dur="00:00:07.00">CARL: And I couldn't imagine what was happening to the other family that was involved.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:38.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Dannyel Passeto – the young man who died in the crash – was not alone in the car that night. He was with his friends. And his older brother was behind the wheel.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:47.00" dur="00:00:06.00">DERRICK: The guy was 20 years old. They said he was a lot like me judging from his stories from his friends and the reports I read, he was a lot like me.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:53.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: In addition to his brother, Dennys, Dannyel had a twin sister -Gabryella.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:58.00" dur="00:00:03.00">DERRICK: ...had a few birthdays since the accident, ... And she dreads it now.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:01.00" dur="00:00:09.00">DERRICK: ...It's not about presents and going out to a fancy restaurant and getting dressed up with your family. That's not what it's about anymore, for her it's about her dead brother.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:10.00" dur="00:00:10.00">LISA: ...twins have that special bond and there's always parts of each other but, I couldn't imagine what it's like for her...</p>
      <p begin="00:04:20.00" dur="00:00:13.00">TV NEWS ANCHOR: A young man faces several years in prison for driving while drunk, 24 year old Derrick Jordan got behind the wheel while intoxicated and his car struck and killed a Boca Raton man 2 and a half years ago...</p>    
      <p begin="00:04:33.00" dur="00:00:10.00">LISA: The day of the hearing was probably without a doubt one of the worst days of my life.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:38.00" dur="00:00:07.00">KYLE: ...and I can almost positively say it was the same for everybody else in our family and in the victim's family.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:45.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DERRICK: His brother looked me right in the eyes and he said, "You gotta pay, man. YOU gotta pay."</p>
      <p begin="00:04:50.00" dur="00:00:12.00">AARON: Me and Derrick had talked about consequences for his actions and that no limited time in prison would be able to kind of make up for what had happened.</p> 
      <p begin="00:05:02.00" dur="00:00:05.00">BRADLEY: Just to try to put yourself in their shoes was overwhelming. Absolutely overwhelming.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.00" dur="00:00:09.00">DERRICK: His mother was there. ...I remember looking at her in the eyes and trying to tell her through just my eyes that I wasn't this monster, that she probably thought that I was.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:16.00" dur="00:00:07.00">DERRICK: ...and so I walked in and they all had these t-shirts with his picture, and at the bottom it said "killed by a drunk driver."</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.00" dur="00:00:10.00">DERRICK: And they all sat right in the front row, they took up the first front rows of the courtroom ...That hit home, that hit home.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:33.00" dur="00:00:05.00">AARON: You try to put that into perspective, how long is he going to have spend in a jail cell...</p> 
      <p begin="00:05:38.00" dur="00:00:13.00">vs. how long the victim's family was going to have to spend without their son, or without their brother or wihtout their best friend... there were losses that were going to have to be incurred b/c of his actions.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:51.00" dur="00:00:07.00">DERRICK: My family is the lucky family. And it's just torn us apart.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:58.00" dur="00:00:03.00">NARRATOR: The financial cost from this high-risk choice has been overwhelming...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:01.00" dur="00:00:07.00">CARL: So far it has probably been in excess of $200,000. That's probably a conservative figure.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:08.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DERRICK: The money is a superficial thing the money comes and goes...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:13.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: But it's the human cost of Derrick's decision that has had an immeasurable impact on him and both families invloved.</p> 
      <p begin="00:06:19.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DERRICK: ...man just that one night! All the pain, the ripple effect it's sent out.</p>
   	  <p begin="00:06:24.00" dur="00:00:05.00">DERRICK: You won't really ever know probably some of the biggest losses...</p>    
      <p begin="00:06:29.00" dur="00:00:06.00">KYLE: He missed my brother's wedding, missed my niece's birth, now I'm trying to look to get married...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:35.00" dur="00:00:05.00">KATHIE: He's still missing all the nuances and the connections and you can't get those back.</p>	  
      <p begin="00:06:40.00" dur="00:00:05.00">AARON: ...your early 20s are some of the best years of your life... Those are things that he'll never be able to come back and experience.</p>	  
      <p begin="00:06:45.00" dur="00:00:07.00">AARON:  ...I'm getting married in June and this kid without question should be my best man unfortunately won't be able to be there for that.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:52.00" dur="00:00:09.00">DERRICK: There's going to be a beautiful photo album and a ton of pictures and I won't be in any one of them. And those pictures will be there forever.</p> 
      <p begin="00:07:01.00" dur="00:00:07.00">DERRICK: ...it took me a while to ever say, I was drinking and driving and I killed somebody.</p> 
      <p begin="00:07:08.00" dur="00:00:09.00">DERRICK: It took me a while to say that. The responsibility of taking another person's life is massive and something that anybody that hasn't done could understand.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:17.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: Opportunities and experiences – forever lost. Reputations and relationships – forever changed. The stigma of always being known as a drunk driver who killed someone.</p>
