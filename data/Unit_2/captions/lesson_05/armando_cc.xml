        <br/>
	   I started drinking when I was about 12 or 13. And the first time that I got drunk we were in a party. It was a wonderful experience because it felt like it was a vehicle to make me feel part of the crowd. Alcohol is ok because my mom, my uncles, everybody drinks, when every role model around you that's around you drinks, it's just so normal like learning how to eat or drink water.

	   I mainly remember him being abusive to his wife. And I used to think oh, I hope he doesn't hurt her. You just knew on his look when he turned. He was getting to that point that you just wanted to hide or not be around during that situation.

	   Heavy drinking made Armando unavailable to his sister, who desperately needed his love and help. Ezdeyna was living with their mother, whose own alcoholism had triggered violent behavior.

	   I was 11 years old and um, he had gotten drunk. He was laying on the sofa and I said, you need to help me, you need to get me out of this situation. I kept saying Armando help me, you know. And all he could do was just say, I can't, I can't do anything.

	   I got many DUIs, that didn't stop me from driving. I thought at the time that I was a better driver when I was drunk. So I was driving and I saw the sirens and the lights, and why are they stopping me for?

	   Many times when I was drunk, I drove with children in the car, and I thought that everybody was going to be happy if I did something funny, so I thought that driving with the lights off was funny...when I was drunk.
