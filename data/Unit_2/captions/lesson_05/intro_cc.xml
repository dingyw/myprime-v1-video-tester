      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:16.75">MAN: I just wasted all that time getting drunk and not going anywhere, and telling myself it would be different tomorrow.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.00" dur="00:00:05.00">WOMAN: They took my mug shots, and gave me my jumpsuit. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:07.00">WOMAN: They stripped me, they put me in a padded cell, and I was probably in there for about seven days. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:08.00">WOMAN: I lost my faith in Christianity; I blamed God for what happened. I stopped going to church.   </p>
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:13.00">WOMAN: Would we have made that choice had we known that germ was on that needle? Probably not, 'cause we were just more concerned with the destination of the high.' </p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MAN: I loved my children, and I loved my family, but you know dope, I loved dope, and it came first, no matter what. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MAN: I lost some really great friends who I selfishly trampled on and kicked out of my life because they no longer served a purpose. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:06.00" dur="00:00:04.00">MAN: I lost more jobs than I could count on two hands. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:03.00">MAN: I lost a lot of trust with my family. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:07.00">MAN: Really screwed up my credit at a young age, and I still today am paying for that. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:20.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MAN: Every time it came time to like re-evaluate and go ok, am I gonna register for another semester, or am I gonna drink, and the answer was always I'm going to drink. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MAN: You won't really ever know what doors might have opened that are now shut down, gates closed, not gonna happen.  </p>
      <p begin="00:01:36.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MAN: The short-term fulfillment, the instant gratification, as empty and hollow as it was, was far better than actually making something of my life. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:44.00" dur="00:00:20.00">WOMAN: I lost my life to it, I lost my dreams.  </p>
      <p begin="00:02:04.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: A father sits alone at a piano, grieving for his son. A son whose life was tragically cut short due to high-risk choices. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:15.00" dur="00:00:11.00">FATHER: I'll re-live that moment a thousand times, it was just a horrific thing. Laura came down and she came off the elevator and, her face, and it was just, there's nothing to explain that.  </p>
      <p begin="00:02:26.00" dur="00:00:15.00">MOTHER: I saw Jason laying there. It looked like he was laying on the couch, sleeping. It just didn't register because I just...there's just a piece of me that's missing. </p>
      <p begin="00:02:41.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: In another family, a high-risk choice cost a young mother the most important thing in her life.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:49.00" dur="00:00:14.00">MOTHER: After drinking heavily for 3 days straight, nonstop, I decided to go for a ride with my son who was six at that time. And on that day I was pulled over, and I already had a previous DUI.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:03.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MOTHER: I remember looking at him and telling him I'm going to jail. I'd been to jail many times before for drinking, but this time they took my son.  </p>
      <p begin="00:03:16.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: What if the things you valued most in life were suddenly taken by a single devastating incident?</p>
      <p begin="00:03:23.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MAN: I was drunk and I was driving, and I made the decision to try to outrun the cops. That one choice has changed my life dramatically and it hurt people that I love dearly.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:36.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: What if the things you cherished slowly dissolved due to a series of high-risk choices?	</p>
      <p begin="00:03:42.00" dur="00:00:15.00">WOMAN: I went from having fun to making really high-risk choices, and it made it easier and easier to do things that were more and more negative for me and had more and more of a negative impact on me and on my life,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:57.00" dur="00:00:03.00">on my functioning, on my relationships.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:00.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: They did not choose for their lives to unravel. Most often they were only choosing to have fun. But these high-risk choices had deep and lasting effects on them, and their loved ones. </p>
      <p begin="00:04:13.00" dur="00:00:09.00">FATHER: Anybody can get into the trap of thinking that this would never happen, just because, you know I'm better than that, or my kids are better than that, or my kids aren't that kind of a person.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:22.00" dur="00:00:04.00">FATHER: So it's very humbling when you experience pain like that.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:26.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Psychological influences, biological factors, and social influences, all play a role in our drug and alcohol choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:35.00" dur="00:00:07.00">MAN: I pretty much grew up with an alcoholic family, my grandpas, my uncles, my dad, all of us drank.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:42.00" dur="00:00:07.00">MOTHER: I just went with the flow because everybody else was doing it. Or I was drinking and I was too drunk but I wanted to be part of the crowd.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:49.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: Sometimes those choices are conscious...sometimes they are not.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MAN: I don't know if there was any specific times where I can say that you know I consciously made the choice because it was just part of everyday life.	</p>
      <p begin="00:05:02.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: We sometimes put what we value at risk without even realizing it.	</p>
      <p begin="00:05:07.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MAN: The more and more you drink, you lose more and more reality of what's legal and what's not legal, you think you're kind of invincible and you can take on the world.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:15.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: We sometimes think that serious problems with alcohol and drugs only happen to certain kinds of people, but in reality they can happen to anyone who makes high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:25.00" dur="00:00:10.00">WOMAN: Going to the worst parts of East LA to get drugs at night, you know, I mean that's not what a blond haired blue eyed girl does, you know. And I did.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:35.00" dur="00:00:26.00">NARRATOR: The stories you see here all share a common thread. They all involve high-risk choices and losing what we treasure most. The outcomes are often devastating. The stories are real.</p>
