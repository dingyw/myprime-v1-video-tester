	   After drinking heavily for 3 days straight, nonstop, I decided to go for a ride with my son who was six at that time.  And on that day I was pulled over, and I already had a previous DUI.  I remember looking at him and telling him I'm going to jail.  I'd been to jail many times before for drinking, but this time they took my son.

		 What if the things you cherished slowly dissolved due to a series of high-risk choices?

      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
		 <b>Woman:  </b>
		 <br/>
		 I went from having fun to making really high-risk choices, and it made it easier and easier to do things that were more and more negative for me and had more and more of a negative impact on me and on my life, on my functioning, on my relationships.  
	</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

		 They did not choose for their lives to unravel. Most often they were only choosing to have fun. But these high-risk choices had deep and lasting effects on them, and their loved ones.

		 <b>Father:  </b>
		 <br/>
		 Anybody can get into the trap of thinking that this would never happen, just because, you know I'm better than that, or my kids are better than that, or my kids aren't that kind of a person.  So it's very humbling when you experience pain like that.

		 Psychological influences, biological factors, and social influences, all play a role in our drug and alcohol choices.

		 <b>Man:  </b>

		 I pretty much grew up with an alcoholic family, my grandpas, my uncles, my dad, all of us drank.

		 <b>Mother:  </b>

		 I just went with the flow because everybody else was doing it.  Or I was drinking and I was too drunk but I wanted to be part of the crowd.

		 <b>Man:  </b>

		 I don't know if there was any specific times where I can say that you know I consciously made the choice because it was just part of everyday life.

		 The more and more you drink, you lose more and more reality of what's legal and what's not legal, you think you're kind of invincible and you can take on the world.
	</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
		 <b>Narrator: </b>
		 <br/>
		 We sometimes think that serious problems with alcohol and drugs only happen to certain kinds of people, but in reality they can happen to anyone who makes high-risk choices.
	</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
		 <b>Woman: </b>

		 Going to the worst parts of East LA to get drugs at night, you know, I mean that's not what a blond haired blue eyed girl does, you know.  And I did.

      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
		 <b>Narrator:</b>
		 <br/>
		 The stories you see here all share a common thread.  They all involve high-risk choices and losing what we treasure most.  The outcomes are often devastating.  The stories are real.
