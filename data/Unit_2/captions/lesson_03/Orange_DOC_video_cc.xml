	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Right, and when we think about how psychological dependence is similar to a love relationship, we can understand how strongly the person in the Orange Phase will defend their high-risk choices.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: It's similar to the way we'd defend a relationship with a friend or family member we want to protect.</p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: So we might rationalize problems in various ways, making them seem minor or a small price to pay for the pleasure of drinking or drug use.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: And we are not likely to go places where our drinking or drug choices are criticized or unwelcome, just as we would not go somewhere a person we loved was not welcome. </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: We are more likely to choose settings where people accept our high-risk choices.</p>
	 <p begin="00:44:00.00" dur="01:30:01.00">NARRATOR: There are many ways we might rationalize our choices. For example, I might be in the Orange Phase but believe I'm in the Yellow or even the Green Phase. </p>
	 <p begin="00:44:00.00" dur="01:30:01.00">NARRATOR: How have I tricked myself? One way is that I might think I'm making low-risk choices. When in reality, I don't bother to count my drinks, or to measure standard drinks when I do count. </p>
	 <p begin="00:44:00.00" dur="01:30:01.00">NARRATOR: Or, I may use a glass that holds two or three standard drinks, but I count it as one. And if I have a fourth or fifth glass, I don't really pay much attention.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:44:00.00" dur="01:30:01.00">NARRATOR: In fact, I might be sort of "grazing" my way through the evening, having one drink or drug after another but not really counting at all.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:44:00.00" dur="01:30:01.00">NARRATOR: Combine all of these, and I might be drinking 6-10 standard drinks and still not think of myself as high-risk drinker. This is one common way defense mechanisms can work.</p>
