	 <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:06.75">ANTONIO: So in the Orange Phase a person might relate to the alcohol or drugs like a friend or even a lover.</p>
	 <p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:13.00">FROSTY: Exactly if you think about how psychological dependence is similar to a love relationship, it really does help us better understand just how strongly someone in the Orange Phase would want to protect their high-risk choices.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:05.00">FROSTY: Much as we would defend or try to protect a relationship with a family member or special friend.</p>
	 <p begin="00:00:25.00" dur="00:00:10.00">EJNA: So for example let's say I have a friend who is very special to me but there not welcome in certain places I probably would not go and the same thing happens with my relationship with the high-risk choices.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:08.00">EJNA: If I to make high-risk choices I'm probably not going to go places where they're not welcome. I'm going to choose to go to places where it's excepted.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: There are many ways we might rationalize our choices. For example, I might be in the Orange Phase but believe I'm in the Yellow or even the Green Phase. </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: How have I tricked myself? One way is that I might think I'm making low-risk choices. When in reality, I don't bother to count my drinks, or to measure standard drinks when I do count. </p>
	 <p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: Or, I may use a glass that holds two or three standard drinks, but I count it as one. And if I have a fourth or fifth glass, I don't really pay much attention.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:01:14.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: In fact, I might be sort of "grazing" my way through the evening, having one drink or drug after another but not really counting at all.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:01:22.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: Combine all of these, and I might be drinking 6-10 standard drinks and still not think of myself as high-risk drinker. This is one common way defense mechanisms can work.</p>
