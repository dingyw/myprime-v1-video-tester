	   Antonio, have you ever heard anyone say, “I can’t really dance until I’ve had a few drinks,” or maybe “I really don’t feel comfortable meeting new people without a beer in my hand?”

	   When that happens, we usually interpret this as meaning that alcohol is somehow a social lubricant that loosens us up, or builds up our confidence, so that we feel comfortable in doing this.  And that may be true, if the person’s a shy person. But, haven’t you heard somebody say this who is not particularly shy or inhibited?

	   Well when that’s the case, we may be talking about state-dependent learning.

	   State-dependent learning. What’s that?

	   State-dependent learning is just when we experience or learn something in one emotional or mental state—we are best able to recall it when we’re back in that state. And it happens with alcohol, it happens with marijuana, it happens with other drugs as well And if I learn a skill or I experience a strong emotion while I’m at a certain blood alcohol level or drug level, I will best be able to recall that skill or emotion when I’m back at that level.

	   Okay, let’s take a look at how state-dependent learning works.
      </p>
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Narrator:</b>

	   This chart shows blood alcohol level on the left and time in hours across the bottom. If we track a person’s blood alcohol level over an evening of drinking, it will form what scientists call a blood alcohol curve.
Look at the blood alcohol curve for a person who’s intoxicated. They will actually reach each blood alcohol level twice – once as they get intoxicated, and then a second time as they get sober. Similar curves can be drawn for any drug use. With a drug like marijuana, the curve begins when THC enters the brain. 
For alcohol, state-dependent learning begins at a blood alcohol level of anywhere between .08 and .11. It will continue until we are so intoxicated that we can’t learn or function well. Then, as we sober up, we get back into a BAL where state-dependent learning can occur. And this will continue until our BAL drops below around .08.
Now, if we connect the points between where state-dependent learning begins and ends, the points form a window of state-dependent learning.  Whether I become intoxicated or not, anything I learn within this window is likely to become state dependent. And that means I remember it best only when my BAL is in this window.
Research shows that state-dependent learning occurs with other drugs as well. Whether it’s simply remembering the words to a song, recalling someone’s name, or a skill like playing pool, if we were in the window when we learned it, we will perform it best only when we are back in the window.

        <b>Narrator:</b>
        <br/>
	   Because drinking and drug use often occur in social settings, social skills are generally the first things to become state dependent. 
So we might experience that we are not comfortable in social settings if we are not drinking or using drugs. Any time we want to use those social skills comfortably, we have to use enough alcohol or drugs to get back in that window. 
Why does this become an issue as I progress from the Yellow to the Orange Phase? Because there are many things happening in my brain... And in my mind.

	   First of all, repeated high-risk use has now changed our brains in a way that has increased tolerance. So it takes more alcohol or drugs to get the feeling we want. It also takes a higher blood alcohol level to reach the point where state-dependent learning stops. In this way my high tolerance expands the state-dependent learning window.
	   In addition, because we have integrated alcohol or drugs into so many aspects of our lives, we have many more opportunities to develop state-dependent learning. 
As my use broadens and my tolerance increases, state-dependent learning occurs in more skill areas.
 I become increasingly dependent on high-risk choices to feel competent and confident.
Let’s look at the pattern that develops...
If I have integrated alcohol or drugs into my life, I am using a lot. As I develop more state-dependent learning, I experience that I am only at my best when I use. I might feel better in social settings when I have been drinking or using. That motivates me to use even higher amounts, and in more situations. Of course, as I use more, my tolerance continues to increase. So, we can see how state-dependent learning, the integration, and tolerance are feeding each other and deepening the psychological dependence.

	   One of the unfortunate outcomes of state-dependent learning is that we may begin to see ourselves as inadequate and unable to function unless we are drinking or using drugs. 
Alcohol or drugs seem to become like a magic potion that allows us to be what we want to be, and do what we want to do. 
State-dependent learning can now cause low self-esteem because we begin to believe, “I’m not very good at things like talking to strangers in a social setting or dancing, but alcohol or drugs lets me do it.”

	   Now it’s important to keep in mind, the skills I’ve learned are my skills. And just because I have learned a skill while making high-risk choices does not mean I can’t relearn it when I’m making low-risk choices.

	   But, what that does mean I have to go through an uncomfortable and often awkward period in my life to relearn those skills in a sober state. And once I do, I’ll have access to those skills anytime, not just when I’m drinking or using. But until then, I’ll depend on the alcohol or drugs to bring out the best in me because it will.
