        <br/>
	   Psychological dependence characterizes the Orange Phase.  The elements of psychological dependence are integration and preoccupation, state dependent learning, sense of relationship, and defenses. 
People in the Orange Phase also experience everything that’s in the Yellow Phase. They continue to make high-risk choices that exceed the 0-1-2-3 guidelines, and their high-risk choices become more frequent.
They can have a significant increase in their tolerance. And they’re even more likely to experience health or impairment problems. Social dependence in the Orange Phase can make their problems seem normal, and intensify their psychological dependence. 
In addition to psychological dependence, people in the Orange Phase may also have problems similar to alcoholism, like memory blackouts and drinking to cure hangovers.
