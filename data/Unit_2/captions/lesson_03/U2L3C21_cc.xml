      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:11.75">NARRATOR: High-risk choices in the Orange Phase are likely to cause an impairment problem. Some examples of this are arrests, fights, relationship problems, injuries, or missed days at work or school.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: In fact, a person in the Orange Phase has a greater risk of death from impaired driving crashes, fights, drowning, or falls.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: Someone in the Orange Phase may also begin to develop health problems like pancreatitis, enlarged liver, stomach problems, or high blood pressure.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: These problems often create emotional, physical, and financial costs. But if social dependence is present, the problems may seem as normal as the high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: People around me might enable me by making excuses for my problems, or covering them up. The combination of social dependence and enabling by others can keep me from seeing the seriousness of my problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:08.00">PETE: You get calls from creditors, these are things where your like, "Oh, I'll get around to it."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:05.00">PETE: There's always tommorrow it seems like there was. And relationships suffered for me.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:04.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PETE: This is another big red flag that I didn't recognise as such at the time because I'm spending all my time hiding this lifestyle, this burden of knowing better is overwhelming.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:16.00" dur="00:00:07.00">PETE: So, it's a fulltime job to hide that much alcohol and cocaine use from people.</p> 	
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:09.00">PETE: So, relationships suffered of course, you have to lie to this person, lie to that person. It gets overwhelming, I guess is the word I keep saying.</p> 	
      <p begin="00:01:32.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PETE: I guess towards my late twenties this was starting to catch up with me, this sort of thing... I was blowing off family functions --families are very important to me.</p> 		
      <p begin="00:01:44.00" dur="00:00:08.00">PETE: I have a ton of neices and nephews I couldn't make their games, their chrisenings, their this, their that.  </p>	
      <p begin="00:01:52.00" dur="00:00:09.00">PETE: These are all... At the time it's ho-hum but as I look back it's a pretty big deal.</p>
