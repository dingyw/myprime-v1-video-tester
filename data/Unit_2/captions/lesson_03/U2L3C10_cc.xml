      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, how do I know if I have psychological dependence on alcohol or drugs? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: If I'm wondering if I'm psychologically dependent, I can really just ask myself a few questions; a couple of examples are: </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: "Have the high-risk choices become a normal part of my life?" and the second question is, "Do I rely on those high-risk choices to have a good time?"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: I could also ask myself, "When something really good or really bad happens in my life, where do I go with that new? Do I turn to a special friend or do I turn to alcohol and drugs?"</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Because if it's the latter, that would suggest that high-risk use is filling some of my personal needs with regards to relationships.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Another component of the psychological dependence has to do with integration and preoccupation. So when I'm not using, are there a lot of moments in my day where random thoughts about alcohol and drug use just kinda pop into my mind?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: If so, that would suggest integration, preoccupation.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: And then another thing I can do is pay careful attention to how I respond to problems that have resulted from high-risk use.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: So, if I have a problem because of my high-risk use, do I change my use, or do I change my lifestyle in order to protect that use?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Frosty, do you have some examples?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Let's say that I've had a driving violation, somehow related to alcohol and drug use, and I don't ever want to have that problem again.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Well, I could do one of two things: I could cut back on my alcohol or drug use, or I could stop driving, or always rely on a designated driver.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Or, let's say that I find that my work is starting to interfere with my partying. So I start looking for a job that has flex work hoursâ€”not so I have flex work hours, but so I have flex drinking hours or flex using hours.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Or maybe I'm a student, and my classes are starting to interfere with the good times.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: So I rearrange my schedule, I just don't plan morning classes, because that allows me to party any night, and sleep in, and get up at the crack of noon of my day.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: Now, this change of lifestyle that we're talking about is a critical point in progression, because what's happening here is every time I change my lifestyle in order to fit with those high-risk choices that I enjoy making,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">I'm becoming more committed to the high-risk choices. And the more committed I am to those high-risk choices, the more I'm moving towards the Red Phase. And it also indicates that psychological dependence is getting stronger.</p>
