      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: This chart shows blood alcohol level on the left and time in hours across the bottom. If we track a person's blood alcohol level over an evening of drinking, it will form what scientists call a blood alcohol curve.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Look at the blood alcohol curve for a person who's intoxicated. They will actually reach each blood alcohol level twice â€“ once as they get intoxicated, and then a second time as they get sober.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Similar curves can be drawn for any drug use. With a drug like marijuana, the curve begins when THC enters the brain.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: For alcohol, state-dependent learning begins at a blood alcohol level of anywhere between .08 and .11. It will continue until we are so intoxicated that we can't learn or function well.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Then, as we sober up, we get back into a BAL where state-dependent learning can occur. And this will continue until our BAL drops below around .08.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Now, if we connect the points between where state-dependent learning begins and ends, the points form a window of state-dependent learning.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Whether I become intoxicated or not, anything I learn within this window is likely to become state dependent. And that means I remember it best only when my BAL is in this window.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Research shows that state-dependent learning occurs with other drugs as well.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Whether it's simply remembering the words to a song, recalling someone's name, or a skill like playing pool, if we were in the window when we learned it, we will perform it best only when we are back in the window.</p>
