      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: As we saw earlier, one effect of marijuana impairment is to focus the user on one thing. With regular use over a period of time, this causes a rebound effect, just as we saw earlier with alcohol. </p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Here's how it works: Theta waves are a measure our ability to pay attention. Because when the brain produces higher levels of theta waves, it becomes more difficult to concentrate.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: And the longer people smoke marijuana, the higher their theta waves when they are not high. This reduction in ability to focus may lead regular marijuana users to let once important goals or plans to slip by.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: It can also increase psychological dependence because a person may begin to feel like they need to use marijuana in order to focus.</p>
