      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:15.75">ALLAN: Regular marijuana users may experience short-term memory problems, even when they're not using. Short-term memory refers to the ability to remember recent things.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALLAN: This means heavy marijuana users might do well at remembering things they learned or experienced some days ago, but is less able to remember what they just learned.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALLAN: For example, they might be driving or carrying on a conversation, and not be able to remember what they just did or said.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ALLAN: Heavy marijuana users may also show impairment in "executive function" of the brain, even when they aren't high. To understand executive function, think of the role of an executive in business.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ALLAN: The executive is in charge, making decisions and supervising others. The executive function of the brain plays a similar role, making decisions and coordinating other brain activities.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ALLAN: It also includes things like mental flexibility, speed of thought, information processing, and some abstract thinking skills.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALLAN: Impaired executive function affects reaction time, the ability to learn and recall words, and the ability to pay attention to more than one thing at a time.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ALLAN: People who use marijuana nearly every day also show deficits in their verbal IQ, especially if they had some difficulty expressing themselves before they began using marijuana.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:25.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALLAN: Verbal IQ measures how well people can understand and express ideas with words. Failure to communicate makes people feel misunderstood and isolated.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:35.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ALLAN: So they may say things like, "No one understands me," or "I'm different, people don't seem to get what I'm saying."</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:42.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALLAN: People with communication problems are also more likely to pull away from important relationships in their lives, because they don't feel that people understand them.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:52.00" dur="00:00:10.00">GEORGE: My experiences with marijuana gave me the sense that marijuana was in fact addictive. It was an addictive substance.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:15.00">GEORGE: Because of my own use of it. It didnt cost as much as other substances--I didnt have to go out and commit crimes in order to do it. But, my compulsive use of it was the same. I wanted to use it all the time.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:17.00" dur="00:00:19.00">GEORGE: I wanted to smoke it all the time. It occupied my time and space. So for me it was an addictive drug. I know they have medical uses for it in ETC. If that works for them, then that's good, but for me, it did not work.</p>
