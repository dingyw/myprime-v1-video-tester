	   It seems like there’s a lot going on in the Orange Phase.
What happens over time to people who have progressed this far?

	   It is a critical point. For many, their lives, careers and relationships are not only injured but sometimes ruined. And yet, even if people have a sense of this, they may be saying, “I still have time, I can keep going like this.” But, in reality, it’s sort of like we’ve been climbing a steep hill and we’ve come to a cliff…
There I am, I’m standing at the edge of the cliff, and I have to make a choice. Either I can turn around and go back down the hill, or I can step over the edge—but I can’t stand here forever. 
So if people in the Orange Phase don’t turn around and go back to the Green Phase by adopting low-risk choices, they will in fact step over edge, and progress on to the Red Phase and develop alcoholism or addiction.

	    So, people in the Orange Phase have a big choice? 
      </p>

	   A lifesaving choice.  But I don’t have to go on to the Red Phase. It’s my choices determine whether or not I do.

	   And the encouraging thing is— research shows about 50% of the people who enter the Orange Phase actually go back to the Green Phase. And that’s because they begin to abstain from using alcohol or drugs, for a variety of reasons. Others begin to make low-risk choices, and if they continue following the low-risk guidelines, they will return back to the Green Phase.

	   And the sooner we make that change, the better our chances of succeeding.

	   That’s true, and when people advance into the Orange Phase, even with the advantage of having this information, they may benefit from some type of counseling or support.
The further I’ve progressed into the Orange Phase, the more likely it is I’m going to need help. Also, the further I’ve progressed, the less likely it is I’m going to be able to make low-risk choices and return to the Green Phase.

	   But it’s possible… people in the Orange Phase can return the Green Phase?

	   They can, and again, about half of them do. And for those who do, there are some real benefits—not the least of which is they stop the progression to high-risk choices that carry them into addiction or alcoholism.
But also, if I enjoy drinking, I can continue to do that by returning the Green Phase and making a commitment to following my low-risk guidelines. 
A really important benefit is that as I break the psychological dependence on the alcohol or the drugs, this allows me to put back together some relationships with people that I care about. 
And finally, for many people in the Orange Phase who make this change, there are some alcohol and drug-related health problems are still reversible. Things like depression, impaired abstract thinking, fatty liver—many of those things can still be reversed at this point, as long as, again, I make a commitment to low-risk choices.

	   Right, It may not be easy. Because of the psychological dependence and the integration of alcohol or drugs in people’s lives, they’re going to have to make significant changes in their lifestyles in order to begin making low-risk choices and to return back to the Green Phase.

	   So, while about 50% of people in the Orange Phase return to the Green Phase, the remaining 50% progress into the Red Phase. 
Unfortunately, most of them don’t even know that they’re near their trigger level. They don’t know that they are facing a lifesaving decision. 
Remember, the longer we stay in the Orange Phase, the more likely we are to progress into the Red Phase.  We’ll look at the Red Phase next. But first, here are some questions about the Orange Phase.
