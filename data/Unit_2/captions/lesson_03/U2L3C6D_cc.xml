	   If I have integrated alcohol or drugs into my life, I am using a lot. As I develop more state-dependent learning, I experience that I am only at my best when I use. I might feel better in social settings when I have been drinking or using. That motivates me to use even higher amounts, and in more situations. Of course, as I use more, my tolerance continues to increase. So, we can see how state-dependent learning, the integration, and tolerance are feeding each other and deepening the psychological dependence.
