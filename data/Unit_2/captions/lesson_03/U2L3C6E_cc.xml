      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: One of the unfortunate outcomes of state-dependent learning is that we may begin to see ourselves as inadequate and unable to function unless we are drinking or using drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Alcohol or drugs seem to become like a magic potion that allows us to be what we want to be, and do what we want to do.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: State-dependent learning can now cause low self-esteem because we begin to believe, "I'm not very good at things like talking to strangers in a social setting or dancing, but alcohol or drugs lets me do it."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: Now it's important to keep in mind, the skills I've learned are my skills. And just because I have learned a skill while making high-risk choices does not mean I can't relearn it when I'm making low-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: But, what that does mean I have to go through an uncomfortable and often awkward period in my life to relearn those skills in a sober state.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: And once I do, I'll have access to those skills anytime, not just when I'm drinking or using. But until then, I'll depend on the alcohol or drugs to bring out the best in me because it will. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so we've talked about state-dependent learning, what else characterizes the Orange Phase?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Think about this: if some special person brings out the best in me, it's only natural that I'd want to spend more time with that person. And over time, I develop a relationship.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: By the time I'm in the Orange Phase, and alcohol or drugs is bringing out the best in me, it's only natural that I'd want to develop a relationship that's every bit as real as a relationship with a person.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: The alcohol or drug is enjoyable and makes me feel good—in fact it may even be better than other relationships in my life.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: But, it's not that people in the Orange Phase consciously think about having a relationship with alcohol or drugs, but they are increasingly turning to the alcohol or drugs in times when they would have otherwise turned to people.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: So for example, if something really good happens to me, instead of thinking, "I can't wait to share this good news with a special friend, a lover, a spouse,"</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">I think, "Wow, I really want to celebrate," which really means, "I wanna get drunk. I wanna get high." On the other hand, if something really bad happens to me, instead of thinking,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">"I need to find the special person who understands," I go find the bottle... I go find the drug. I drown my sorrows, I get high so I won't have to think about it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: And so the more I do this, the more I turn to the alcohol or the drugs, when usually I would have turned to other people, the more it builds that relationship or that sense of a friend or a lover.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: It's a companion—it's somebody I can have fun with. But it's not just the substance—it's the friends, the parties, the events, it's everything about it—I love it all.</p>
