	   A person might experience muddy thinking in the Yellow Phase.  But this type of impairment, as well as problems with abstract thinking, is much more likely to occur in the Orange Phase. 
A person who has five drinks in a day is likely to have trouble with abstract thinking, even when they’re not intoxicated or hung over. 
And a person who has two or three six-packs a day is even more likely to experience these problems. 
Impaired abstract thinking often affects job performance.

	   At this point, the brain changes that cause impaired abstract thinking are still reversible. So, if a person consistently makes low-risk choices, their mental abilities are likely to improve. 
However, if a person continues drinking in high-risk quantities, they’ll never be functioning at their peak, even when they’re completely sober. 
Ironically, the impaired abstract thinking makes this more difficult to see.  People may think that their job or school is “getting harder,” which may even make them want to party more to deal with the stress. This creates a cycle where the more I party, the worse I do, and the worse I do, the more stress I have and the more I want to party.

	   I was living in the Bronx--I was at my friend's house in New Jersey, and we were at this party, there was a keg. And I'm not saying I didn't drink--it was never an issue. We did Quaaludes, we were smoking pot, and so I turned to this girl--this fits the story--and I said the this girl, Bonnie, "One time I got so carried away that I got carried away," and I started to laugh, and it's the last thing I remember saying. And apparently I was singing songs, a good half-hour after they were off the stereo. The story to me was funny, but I woke up at home, and I don't know how I got there. I had to retrace my steps and talk to 20 different people to find out how I got from New Jersey to the Bronx--cause I woke up in my bed.

	   I had to go visit my sister once upon a time, and I was just completely drunk. It was a Friday night, I drank probably about 15 beers at the age of 13. I ended up taking a cab, didn't know how the hell I made it home. I managed to get there, and lost my wallet, lost my phone, didn't have a clue where I was. Somehow I guess I just stumbled into our apartment and miraculously. I ended up in the morning very very hung over and never wanted to do that again. Of course the next day you feel differently, and everything is OK, it's fine...

	   I blacked out many times--I would wake up in my bed--but usually I knew how I got there cause I was just across the street, so it didn't matter. But a couple of times I was out-of-state, and ended up in my bed, and that's kinda freaky.
