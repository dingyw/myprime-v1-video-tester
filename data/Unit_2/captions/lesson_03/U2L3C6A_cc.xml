      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">NARRATOR: Because drinking and drug use often occur in social settings, social skills are generally the first things to become state dependent.</p>

      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: So we might experience that we are not comfortable in social settings if we are not drinking or using drugs.</p>
