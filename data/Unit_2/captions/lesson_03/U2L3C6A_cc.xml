	   Because drinking and drug use often occur in social settings, social skills are generally the first things to become state dependent. 
So we might experience that we are not comfortable in social settings if we are not drinking or using drugs. Any time we want to use those social skills comfortably, we have to use enough alcohol or drugs to get back in that window. 
Why does this become an issue as I progress from the Yellow to the Orange Phase? Because there are many things happening in my brain... And in my mind.
