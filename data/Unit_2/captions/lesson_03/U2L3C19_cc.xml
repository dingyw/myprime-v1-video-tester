      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">NARRATOR: People making high-risk choices often have hangovers and may quickly learn that another drink eases their symptoms. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:15.00">NARRATOR: Most people don't consider having a bloody mary, screwdriver, or beer as a hangover cure to be serious. Yet, drinking to ease a hangover is very similar to drinking to cure withdrawal, just on a smaller scale.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: There's a reason why alcohol can help to relieve a hangover. Alcohol initially produces a depressant effect on the central nervous system.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:15.00">NARRATOR: Then it produces a mild "rebound," or stimulant effect, which can cause some degree of restlessness, nervousness, or shaking. The more a person drinks on any day, the greater the rebound effect.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: If we've have had a large amount to drink, the rebound will be noticeable. We'll feel slightly nervous or agitated the next morning, even though the alcohol itself is out of our system.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: If we take another drink to relieve this nervousness, the drink provides a mild depressant effect and makes us feel more comfortable. Not all hangover symptoms are signs of this rebound effect.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:14.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: For example, dry mouth, headache, and nausea can result from other factors; here we're only talking about nervous agitation. </p>
      <p begin="00:01:24.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: To help understand this rebound effect, think about  what happens when we hold a beach ball under water. The surface of the water is like the normal level of nervous system activity.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:36.00" dur="00:00:17.00">NARRATOR: Below the water represents a low level of nervous system activity, and above the water is like hyperactivity. When we push the ball down and let it go, it doesn't just go to the surface--it rebounds above the surface.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:53.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: This effect is similar to what happens with our nervous system.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: Once someone experiences the rebound, that person may begin using alcohol or other drugs to counter the stimulant effects, leading to a pattern of using multiple drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:10.00" dur="00:00:16.00">NARRATOR: And this rebound is not limited to alcohol or other depressant drugs. If a person has been taking stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine, then the rebound effect is depression, and it can occur very quickly.</p>
