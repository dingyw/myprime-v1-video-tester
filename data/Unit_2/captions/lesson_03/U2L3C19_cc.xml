	   People making high-risk choices often have hangovers and may quickly learn that another drink eases their symptoms. Most people don’t consider having a bloody mary, screwdriver, or beer as a hangover cure to be serious. Yet, drinking to ease a hangover is very similar to drinking to cure withdrawal, just on a smaller scale.
There’s a reason why alcohol can help to relieve a hangover. Alcohol initially produces a depressant effect on the central nervous system. Then it produces a mild “rebound,” or stimulant effect, which can cause some degree of restlessness, nervousness, or shaking. The more a person drinks on any day, the greater the rebound effect. 
If we’ve have had a large amount to drink, the rebound will be noticeable. We’ll feel slightly nervous or agitated the next morning, even though the alcohol itself is out of our system. If we take another drink to relieve this nervousness, the drink provides a mild depressant effect and makes us feel more comfortable. Not all hangover symptoms are signs of this rebound effect. For example, dry mouth, headache, and nausea can result from other factors; here we’re only talking about nervous agitation. 
To help understand this rebound effect, think about  what happens when we hold a beach ball under water. The surface of the water is like the normal level of nervous system activity. Below the water represents a low level of nervous system activity, and above the water is like hyperactivity. When we push the ball down and let it go, what happens? It doesn't just go to the surface--it rebounds above the surface.
This effect is similar to what happens with our nervous system. Once someone experiences the rebound, that person may begin using alcohol or other drugs to counter the stimulant effects, leading to a pattern of using multiple drugs. 
And this rebound is not limited to alcohol or other depressant drugs. If a person has been taking stimulants such as cocaine or methamphetamine, then the rebound effect is depression, and it can occur very quickly.
