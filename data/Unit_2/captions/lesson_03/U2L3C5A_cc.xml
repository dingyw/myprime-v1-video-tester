      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Antonio, have you ever heard anyone say, "I can't really dance until I've had a few drinks," or maybe "I really don't feel comfortable meeting new people without a beer in my hand?"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Absolutely.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: When that happens, we usually interpret this as meaning that alcohol is somehow a social lubricant that loosens us up, or builds up our confidence, so that we feel comfortable in doing this.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: And that may be true, if the person's a shy person. But, haven't you heard somebody say this who is not particularly shy or inhibited?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Sure.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FROSTY: Well when that's the case, we may be talking about state-dependent learning.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: State-dependent learning. What's that? </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: State-dependent learning is just when we experience or learn something in one emotional or mental stateâ€”we are best able to recall it when we're back in that state.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">EJNA: And it happens with alcohol, it happens with marijuana, it happens with other drugs as well And if I learn a skill or I experience a strong emotion while I'm at a certain blood alcohol level or drug level,</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">I will best be able to recall that skill or emotion when I'm back at that level.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, let's take a look at how state-dependent learning works.</p>
