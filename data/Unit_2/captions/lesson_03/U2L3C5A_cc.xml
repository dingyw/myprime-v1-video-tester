	   Antonio, have you ever heard anyone say, “I can’t really dance until I’ve had a few drinks,” or maybe “I really don’t feel comfortable meeting new people without a beer in my hand?” 
      </p>

	   Absolutely.

	   When that happens, we usually interpret this as meaning that alcohol is somehow a social lubricant that loosens us up, or builds up our confidence, so that we feel comfortable in doing this.  And that may be true, if the person’s a shy person. But, haven’t you heard somebody say this who is not particularly shy or inhibited?

	   Sure.

	   Well when that’s the case, we may be talking about state-dependent learning.

	   State-dependent learning. What’s that?

	   State-dependent learning is just when we experience or learn something in one emotional or mental state—we are best able to recall it when we’re back in that state. And it happens with alcohol, it happens with marijuana, it happens with other drugs as well And if I learn a skill or I experience a strong emotion while I’m at a certain blood alcohol level or drug level, I will best be able to recall that skill or emotion when I’m back at that level.

	   Okay, let’s take a look at how state-dependent learning works.
