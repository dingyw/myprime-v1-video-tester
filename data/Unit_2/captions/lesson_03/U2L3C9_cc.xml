      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">NARRATOR: There are many ways we might rationalize our choices. For example, I might be in the Orange Phase but believe I'm in the Yellow or even the Green Phase. How have I tricked myself?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: One way is that I might think I'm making low-risk choices. When in reality, I don't bother to count my drinks, or to measure standard drinks when I do count.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: Or, I may use a glass that holds two or three standard drinks, but I count it as one. And if I have a fourth or fifth glass, I don't really pay much attention.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:08.00">NARRATOR: In fact, I might be sort of "grazing" my way through the evening, having one drink or drug after another but not really counting at all.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:13.00">NARRATOR: Combine all of these, and I might be drinking 6-10 standard drinks and still not think of myself as high-risk drinker. This is one common way defense mechanisms can work.</p>
