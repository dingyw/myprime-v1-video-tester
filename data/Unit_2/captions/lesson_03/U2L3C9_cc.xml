	   There are many ways we might rationalize our choices. For example, I might be in the Orange Phase but believe I’m in the Yellow or even the Green Phase. How have I tricked myself? 
One way is that I might think I’m making low-risk choices. When in reality, I don’t bother to count my drinks, or to measure standard drinks when I do count. 
Or, I may use a glass that holds two or three standard drinks, but I count it as one. And if I have a fourth or fifth glass, I don’t really pay much attention. In fact, I might be sort of “grazing” my way through the evening, having one drink or drug after another but not really counting at all. Combine all of these, and I might be drinking 6-10 standard drinks and still not think of myself as high-risk drinker. This is one common way defense mechanisms can work.
