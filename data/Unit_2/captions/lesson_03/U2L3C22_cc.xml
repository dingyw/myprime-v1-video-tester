	   Earlier we heard from Jean Kilbourne about how alcohol advertisers target drinkers in the Yellow Phase with carefully crafted messages. Now, let’s take a look at the kinds of messages they use to appeal to people in the Orange Phase.

	   In the Orange Phase, the anticipation of drinking moves to preoccupation with drinking. Once again the advertisers make this seem normal, as if everyone were preoccupied with alcohol. 
“Life, liberty and the pursuit of happy hour”
Many ads encourage us to feel that it is perfectly normal and appropriate to want to drink all the time:
"Live. Laugh. Love. Sleep later."
"I go out on Tuesday, but I go all out on Friday"
Ads also tell us that it is normal to drink huge quantities of alcohol. 
“She walked into the room with a 16-oz glass full of Maker’s Mark. My dad looked up and remarked, ‘I’d say she’s a keeper.’”

	   We are told (and want to believe) that we don't really need a reason or excuse to drink any more:
"Is there anything not worth drinking to?"
Life without alcohol is boring, and one works only to have money for drinking

	   As the Orange Phase progresses, problems become likely. We may start to risk some of the things we value. Social dependence makes this seem normal, and the ads often contribute to this sense of normalcy. The ads make light of both how important alcohol has become and the consequences that go with it. They tell us the beer is “always worth it.”

	    In the Orange Phase, our relationship with the alcohol can be more important than our relationships with people. This shows up in ad after ad.

		 After all, it can seem safer and more satisfying to be involved with alcohol rather than a person. 
"Grab something you're allowed to."
"Your bourbon has a great body and fine character. I wish the same could be said for my girlfriend."
But what does it say if our relationship with alcohol is as important or more important than our relationships with people?
