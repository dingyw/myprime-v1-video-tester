      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Earlier we heard from Jean Kilbourne about how alcohol advertisers target drinkers in the Yellow Phase with carefully crafted messages. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Now, let's take a look at the kinds of messages they use to appeal to people in the Orange Phase. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: In the Orange Phase, the anticipation of drinking moves to preoccupation with drinking. Once again the advertisers make this seem normal, as if everyone were preoccupied with alcohol.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: "Life, liberty and the pursuit of happy hour"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Many ads encourage us to feel that it is perfectly normal and appropriate to want to drink all the time:</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: "Live. Laugh. Love. Sleep later." "I go out on Tuesday, but I go all out on Friday" Ads also tell us that it is normal to drink huge quantities of alcohol.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: "She walked into the room with a 16-oz glass full of Maker's Mark. My dad looked up and remarked, ‘I'd say she's a keeper.'"</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">(Woman describing the features of the house, and the large clothing closet, to her friends, who exclaim excitedly.) (Man showing his beer room to his friends, who exclaim excitedly)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: We are told (and want to believe) that we don't really need a reason or excuse to drink any more: "Is there anything not worth drinking to?"</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Life without alcohol is boring, and one works only to have money for drinking (Commercial music playing)</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: They tell us it is fine to carry our own supply, wherever we might go:</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">COMMERCIAL NARRATOR: It's a long way from here to the 19th hole. A wise man provisions himself accordingly. That's the spirit. You can always borrow a ball. The high life.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: As the Orange Phase progresses, problems become likely. We may start to risk some of the things we value.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: Social dependence makes this seem normal, and the ads often contribute to this sense of normalcy. The ads make light of both how important alcohol has become and the consequences that go with it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: They tell us the beer is "always worth it."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">FISHERMAN: They're really biting today.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">SECOND FISHERMAN: It's all about the lure!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALIEN FISHERMAN: They're really biting today.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">SECOND ALIEN FISHERMAN: It's all about the lure!</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">COMMERCIAL NARRATOR: Bud Light—always worth it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: In the Orange Phase, our relationship with the alcohol can be more important than our relationships with people. This shows up in ad after ad.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN IN COMMERCIAL: If me and Buster were hanging over a cliff, and you could only save one of us, which one would you save?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MAN: Easy--you.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN: Ooh, me or your mom?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">WOMAN: Your Miller Lite?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MAN:	Aahh. Uhhh... How high is the cliff?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">COMMERCIAL NARRATOR:	Do you love the taste of your beer this much? Well, you could. Try the great pilsner taste of a triple-hops-brewed Miller Lite. Taste Greatness.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MAN: (mockingly) "If me and Buster were hanging off a cliff" What is she talking about?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: After all, it can seem safer and more satisfying to be involved with alcohol rather than a person. "Grab something you're allowed to."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: "Your bourbon has a great body and fine character. I wish the same could be said for my girlfriend."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">JEAN KILBOURNE: But what does it say if our relationship with alcohol is as important or more important than our relationships with people?</p>
