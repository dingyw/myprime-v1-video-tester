      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:07.75">NARRATOR: Social dependence often begins in the Yellow Phase, but will intensify in the Orange Phase with psychological dependence. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:08.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: At this point it's not only the high-risk use that seems normal, but the problems that often go along with the high-risk choices also begin to seem normal.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:17.00" dur="00:00:02.00">FIRST MAN: Yeah, I got a DUI on the way home last night.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:03.00">SECOND MAN: Dude, join the club.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:02.00">WOMAN: Sounds like you need a drink.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:02.00">SECOND MAN: Mmm, yeah.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:02.00">WAITER: ...are you guys okay?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:02.00">FIRST MAN: ...can I get another one? (group clinks glasses)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: Once psychological and social dependence are present, alcohol or drugs are so integrated into life that I'm not likely to be as comfortable socializing with people who aren't making high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:07.00">NARRATOR: Before long, I'm part of social group where people I socialize with are drinking very similarly to me.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:48.00" dur="00:00:02.00">WOMAN: The cops around here just need to lighten up.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:02.00">BOTH MEN: Drink to that! (group clinks glasses)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: Even experiencing a problem does not seem that unusual to me. Others experiencing the same problem may see it as a reason to change. For me, it might just seem like the cost of having a good time.      </p>
	  <p begin="00:01:06.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MOSES: I ended up finding myself in these social gatherings where people would encourage me to have fun quote-unquote, and hang out with them,</p>  
	  <p begin="00:01:19.00" dur="00:00:11.00">sort of just lounge around, be by their side, entertaining them, by drinking and smoking and drugs and such.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:30.00" dur="00:00:15.00">MOSES: The social aspect of that was quite gratifying at the time. But, the ramifications that it brought were just tremendous.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:45.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MOSES: There would always be this group of people who would try to lead you to go to this party, or go to that party, or have another shot, or have another drink, or have another beer. And they're always encouraging you.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:07.00">MOSES: And you feel like you're in the moment, and you feel like you're the man, because you're doing what they're telling you to do,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:05.00" dur="00:00:10.00">and they're laughing at you because you're so completely out of it and drunk and wasted, uncontrollable, not being able to control your body.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:15.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MOSES: But it feels like that social aspect is interesting because you can always find them somewhere in this world.</p>
