      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">(Friendly arguing about a football game) NARRATOR: This time, weâ€™ll see how a game-watch might play out for someone in the Orange Phase.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:14.00">NARRATOR: A person in the Orange Phase continues to anticipate high-risk drinking or drug use. (Continued arguing about a football game, doorbell rings)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:07.00">TRAVIS: I'll grab it. (Continued arguing about a football game)</p>	  
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:02.00">MIGUEL: What's goin' on, Travis?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:04.00">TRAVIS: Hey Miguel! We got some food over there, and I think we got a beer in the fridge. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MIGUEL: Cool--this should get us started! I'll make a run in the second quarter to get some more. (Continued arguing about a football game)</p>
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: As a person moves further into the Orange Phase, alcohol and drug use becomes an important part of life. They may become accustomed to drinking when they watch sports or television, before going to bed, or while cooking dinner.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: And if they can't use during these times, it's likely to cause anxiety or disappointment. To avoid this, a person in the Orange Phase may be willing to spend quite a bit of time planning, getting and using the drug or alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: At this point, the anticipation is moving to preoccupation. The high-risk drinking or drug use is now a central part of life. And for some people, it becomes part of their identity.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:21.00" dur="00:00:10.00">NARRATOR: They may consider themselves to be an experienced and knowledgeable drinker or drug user, and their preoccupation can take on the appearance of a hobby.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:31.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: They might have a nice bar in their home, buy a bong, start a collection of bottles, or wear clothing that displays their favorite drug or brand of alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:40.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: People in the late Orange Phase may think and talk in high-risk quantities more often.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:46.00" dur="00:00:04.00">MIGUEL: What about a power hour? Do a beer shot every minute!</p>
      <p begin="00:01:50.00" dur="00:00:01.00">TRAVIS: One a minute?</p>
      <p begin="00:01:51.00" dur="00:00:01.00">MIGUEL: Just one...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:52.00" dur="00:00:15.00">NARRATOR: To someone in the Orange Phase an activity just isn't much fun without alcohol or drugs. So if they aren't present, they'll probably choose to bring their own, or go somewhere else.</p>
