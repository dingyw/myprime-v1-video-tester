	   When a person in the Yellow Phase gets together to watch a game, or hang out with friends, they look forward to the drinking or drugs about as much as they look forward to the event. 
It’s now an important part of their social life, and doing these things without the alcohol or drugs doesn’t see like as much fun because drinking isn’t just a part of a good time, it’s the way to a good time.
In the Yellow Phase, alcohol and drugs are often a central part of a person’s social life and relationships. They believe it makes fun possible. This attitude makes drinking or drug use more important to them, so they are more likely to drink or use more.
As a person moves further into the Orange Phase, alcohol and drug use becomes an important part of life.  They may become accustomed to drinking when they watch sports or television, before going to bed, or while cooking dinner.  And if they can’t use during these times, it’s likely to cause anxiety or disappointment.  To avoid this, a person in the Orange Phase may be willing to spend quite a bit of time planning, getting and using the drug or alcohol.
At this point, the anticipation is moving to preoccupation. The high-risk drinking or drug use is now a central part of life. And for some people, it becomes part of their identity. 
They may consider themselves to be an experienced and knowledgeable drinker or drug user, and their preoccupation can take on the appearance of a hobby.  They might have a nice bar in their home, buy a bong, start a collection of bottles, or wear clothing that displays their favorite drug or brand of alcohol.
People in the late Orange Phase may think and talk in high-risk quantities more often.

	   To someone in the Orange Phase an activity just isn’t much fun without alcohol or drugs. So if they aren’t present, they’ll probably choose to bring their own, or go somewhere else.
