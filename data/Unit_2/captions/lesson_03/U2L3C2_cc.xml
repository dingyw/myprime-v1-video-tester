	   Okay, so we’ve talked about characteristics of the Green and Yellow Phase--but what sets the Orange Phase apart? `
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

	   Well, what sets the Orange Phase apart from the Yellow Phase is the emergence of psychological dependence. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   I’ve heard about psychological dependence before, but what exactly does it mean? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ejna:</b>
        <br/>
	   Well, psychological dependence sounds abnormal, so people will immediately think, “No, not me. I can't possibly be psychologically dependent.” But, in reality, it's very normal. It just simply means that we've come to depend on something or someone to function normally. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   That doesn’t sound like such a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty:</b>
        <br/>
	   Well, it’s not.  We're all psychologically dependent on something; and for most of us, that would be our family, our friends, spouse, lover, if we're lucky, maybe even our job. And if you were to remove from my life that which I were psychologically dependent on, I'm likely to experience “emotional pain and withdrawal” and that's normal. But, when the thing that I'm psychologically dependent on is hurting me, maybe even killing me--that is not normal.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ejna:</b>
        <br/>
	   We could think of it this way—do you remember in the Yellow Phase, the most common reason for making high-risk choices is to have fun? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio:</b>
        <br/>
	   Sure.
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Ejna:</b>
        <br/>
	   Well one of the first changes we see for people who have psychological dependence is they now rely on high-risk choices to have a good time.  
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty:</b>
        <br/>
	   So one of the differences between Yellow and Orange is that in the Yellow Phase I made high-risk choices as the route to good times. By the time I’m in the Orange Phase, high-risk choices is the good times. And it’s really hard for me even to imagine having fun with people, at parties, or other activities, if alcohol and drugs isn’t part of the scene. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Antonio: </b>
        <br/>
	   So people are making high-risk choices because they are psychologically dependent? 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        <b>Frosty: </b>
        <br/>
	   Well, it’s kind of the other way around. High-risk choices themselves lead to psychological dependence.  But once present, psychological dependence becomes a powerful influence on continued high-risk choices. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">

		 Okay, now we’re going to take a look at some experiences people may have in the Orange Phase.
