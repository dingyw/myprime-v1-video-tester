	   First of all, repeated high-risk use has now changed our brains in a way that has increased tolerance. So it takes more alcohol or drugs to get the feeling we want. It also takes a higher blood alcohol level to reach the point where state-dependent learning stops. In this way my high tolerance expands the state-dependent learning window.
