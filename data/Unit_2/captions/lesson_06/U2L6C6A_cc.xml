		Earlier we saw how there is an interaction between social influences and our choices. The social influences in my life also react to any problem that I might experience. Social influences can be positive and supportive, but they can also support my high-risk choices if I am in a socially-dependent group. Social dependence makes problems seem like no big deal to me because, after all, similar things have happened to other people I know.
