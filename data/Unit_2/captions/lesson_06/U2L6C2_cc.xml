		If I'm in the Orange or Red Phase, and I experience problems, it might be very clear to the people around me, my friends and family, that alcohol and drugs are the source of my problems, but it may not be clear to me at all.

		<br/>
		So if that's true, how do I figure out what's going on?

		I think if we answer a couple of questions it can help us. One is, what’s going on in my experience that tricks me into believing that alcohol and drugs are the solution to my problems, instead of the source of my problems. And, a similar question is just in general: what’s going on that causes me to experience my alcohol and drug use so differently than other people experience it. And once we answer those questions, I think it becomes clear to us why other people are experiencing our alcohol and drug problems and are concerned about it, while we just experience them as meddling in our business.
