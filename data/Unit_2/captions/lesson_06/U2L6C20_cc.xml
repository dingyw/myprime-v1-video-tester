       <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: So if I'm living in this Spiral, my experience might be, alcohol and drugs are the solution to my problems. People who love me, who are not part of drinking or drug using group, might look at me and say, "Alcohol and drugs are the cause of his problems.</p>  
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: They wonder why you can't see it?</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Yes. We have very different perspectives. They look at my life through their perspective, I look at it through mine, and they're completely different.</p> 
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: I might start hearing things from people who care about me, things like, "Would you just slow down your alcohol and drug use?" Or, "Can't you just reduce it, or do a little less?</p> 
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Or, "Please, stop." Now to me, it just might seem like they're being unreasonable, like they're on my case. But what it might be is an indication that my experience in the Spiral is tricking me and I'm not seeing things as they are.</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: And the Spiral explains why this happens.</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Yes, it explains why people often have many more problems than they know they've got, and why people will often think they're in a lower phase than they're really in.</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: At this point in the program, sometimes people are thinking, "Wow, part of this sounds familiar."</p> 
	   <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Others don't think so. In either case, we would like you to take a moment to reflect on your experiences with alcohol and drugs, and just consider to what extent elements of the Spiral might be at work in your life.</p>
