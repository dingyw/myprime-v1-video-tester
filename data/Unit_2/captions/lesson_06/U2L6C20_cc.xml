       <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:08.75">RAY: So if I'm living in this Spiral, my experience might be, alcohol and drugs are the solution to my problems.</p> 
       <p begin="00:00:09.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: People who love me, who are not part of my drinking or drug using group, they look at me and say, "Alcohol and drugs are the cause of his problems.</p>  
	   <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: They wonder why you can't see it?</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: Yes. We have very different perspectives. They look at my life through their perspective, I look at it through mine, and they're completely different.</p> 
	   <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:13.00">RAY: I might start hearing things from people who care about me, things like, "Would you just slow down your alcohol and drug use?" Or, "Can't you just reduce it, or can't you do a little less?"</p> 
	   <p begin="00:00:43.00" dur="00:00:07.00">RAY: Or, "Please, stop." Now to me, it just might seem like they're being unreasonable, like they're always on my case.</p> 
       <p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: But what it might be is an indication that my experience in the Spiral has tricked me and I'm not seeing things clearly.</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And the Spiral explains why this happens.</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: Yes it does, it explains why people often have many more problems than they know they've got, and why people will often think they're in a lower phase than they're really in.</p>	  
	   <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: At this point in the program, sometimes people are thinking, "Wow, part of this sounds familiar."</p> 
	   <p begin="00:01:19.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ANTONIO: Others don't think so. In either case, we would like you to take a moment to reflect on your experiences with alcohol and drugs, and just consider to what extent elements of the Spiral might be at work in your life.</p>
