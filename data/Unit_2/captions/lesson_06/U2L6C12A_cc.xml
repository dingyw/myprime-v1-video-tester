		State-dependent learning can also be a part of the spiral. State dependent learning locks up things that I learn when making high-risk choices so that I am not able to remember them or do them well when I am sober. In the yellow phase, state dependent learning begins to “lock up” social skills. By the orange phase, it can lock up emotions as well. This is extensive enough to become a major influence on drinking or drug choices, because many of the things I want to do can be done best or most comfortably only when making high-risk choices.
