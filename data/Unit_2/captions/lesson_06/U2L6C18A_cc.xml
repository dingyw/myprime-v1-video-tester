      <p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: Memory blackouts are one example. Blackouts erase the memory of some problems. Let's say that I got intoxicated at a party and caused a big fight that really ruined the night for everybody.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:19.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: If you were with me at the party, and you were not in a blackout, then you would clearly see a problem that I would have no memory of. So, it does not seem like a problem to me, because I don't remember it happening!</p>
