      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:08.00">LISA: I shouldn't feel bad about doing it even though I have a child because I am an adult I make my own decisions, that's how I'd rationalize it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:08.00">LISA: But in the back of my head I knew it was still that if I have to sit there and rationalize it --doing drugs-- probably a little irrational all in it's self.</p>
