      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Similar to state dependent learning is withdrawal learning. Withdrawal learning can trick us in a similar way, but at a different point in a drinking or drug use episode.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: The first time I drink or use to cure a hangover in the orange phase, I learn, "If I feel bad, using will make me feel better."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: In the red phase, when I fear I am dying during withdrawal and I take another drink or drug, the feeling of dying stops. This is very powerful learning.</p>
