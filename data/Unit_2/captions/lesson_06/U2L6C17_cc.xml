		I can’t tell you my first, but I can remember being around 14 years, and I was at a party with some older people, and there was a cute boy there, and again I was 13, 14… I remember talking to this person, and I remember this craziness of people opening a car door and dragging me out of the back of a car… Somehow, between when I had started drinking and gotten into a car, I had gotten drunk, gone off with a boy older than I, and ended up in a backseat of a car, in an incredibly vulnerable position. And I don’t remember what happened in between there. And it didn’t scare me! What’s wrong with that, you know? And I actually had forgotten completely about that until just recently. I blacked out all the time.
