      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RACHEL: And I remember drinking and I remember there was a cute boy there, and again I was 13, 14, 13 maybe...</p>

      <p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:17.00">RACHEL: Somehow, between the time I had started drinking and when the car door opened, I had gotten drunk, I had gone off with a boy older than I, and ended up in a backseat of a car, in an incredibly vulnerable position.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:17.00">RACHEL: And I don't remember what happened in between there. But it didn't scare me! What's wrong with that, you know? And I actually had forgotten completely about that until just recently. I remembered that situation.</p>
