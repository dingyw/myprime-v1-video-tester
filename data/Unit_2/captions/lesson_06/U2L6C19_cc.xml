		Let’s look at  what happens to my perception of problems as I go through the Spiral.
Social dependence makes problems seem normal. If everyone in our social group is experiencing the same problems, they don’t seem unusual.
Enabling removes consequences. When people around us make excuses for us, they prevent us from experiencing the pain of consequences.
Psychological defenses trick us. As we use more and more defenses, it becomes more difficult for us to connect our problems to drinking or drugs.
Memory blackouts erase memories of our problems, since they often happen at the same time.
State dependent learning increasingly locks up emotions and things that we learn when making high-risk choices, so that we are not able to remember them or do them as well when we are sober. <br />
Impaired abstract thinking distorts cause and effect. This makes it hard for us to connect the problems to the alcohol or drug use. 
Withdrawal learning teaches us that using is the solution to, and not the cause of, our problems. 
When I am caught in the spiral, my drinking or drug use has so distorted my perception that I am not always aware of the true nature of the problem.
