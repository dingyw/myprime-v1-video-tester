      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Let's look at  what happens to my perception of problems as I go through the Spiral.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Social dependence makes problems seem normal. If everyone in our social group is experiencing the same problems, they don't seem unusual.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Enabling removes consequences. When people around us make excuses for us, they prevent us from experiencing the pain of consequences.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Psychological defenses trick us. As we use more and more defenses, it becomes more difficult for us to connect our problems to drinking or drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Memory blackouts erase memories of our problems, since they often happen at the same time.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: State dependent learning increasingly locks up emotions and things that we learn when making high-risk choices, so that we are not able to remember them or do them as well when we are sober.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Impaired abstract thinking distorts cause and effect. This makes it hard for us to connect the problems to the alcohol or drug use.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Withdrawal learning teaches us that using is the solution to, and not the cause of, our problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: When I am caught in the spiral, my drinking or drug use has so distorted my perception that I am not always aware of the true nature of the problem.</p>
