      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:05.75">NARRATOR: Have you noticed that when people are in the Orange or Red Phase, other people can see what is happening to them long before they can see it?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:06.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: What is it that often keeps people from seeing that their problems are a result of their high-risk choices? The answer to that question is in the formula that we've been discussing.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:05.00">NARRATOR: As we saw earlier in the formula, we control our choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:09.00">NARRATOR: With repeated high-risk use, our bodies and brains begin to experience changes... changes that motivate us to make even more high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: At the same time, social and psychological influences can reinforce our increasing pattern of high-risk use.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:06.00">NARRATOR: When these experiences start to build on each other, we can become trapped in a spiral.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:11.00">NARRATOR: This spiral can blind us to the full impact of our choices. We don't perceive problems the same way that those around us do. And, the Spiral can propel our progression through the phases.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:12.00">NARRATOR: We're going to look at some of the experiences that happen within the spiral to better understand why people in the Orange and Red Phases often cannot see that their drinking or drug use is causing problems.</p>
