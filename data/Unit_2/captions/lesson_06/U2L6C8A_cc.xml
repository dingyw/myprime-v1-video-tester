		Another factor that contributes to my confusion is enabling. Enabling refers to ways that other people encourage my high-risk choices. At first, this may simply be that they accept my choices. But, as problems start occurring, people around me might start covering up for me or rescuing me. So, each time people rescue me from some or all of the natural painful consequences associated with alcohol or drug problems—such as fines, jail sentences, missed assignments, or missed days at work—I become more convinced that there is nothing dangerous about my choices.
