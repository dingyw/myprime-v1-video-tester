      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: As I continue around the spiral, sometimes I trick myself about what is really causing my problems. These reactions are known as psychological defenses.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: We can think of psychological defenses as a shield that keeps me from knowing the truth. It is normal for people to use defenses.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: But, as I move through the phases, the shield of defenses becomes much larger, and no longer normal. My defenses have helped convince me that the real problem is something other than my drinking or drug use. </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: It's my spouse, my job, bad luck, or that policeman who had a quota to fill. I defend my drinking or drug use by making excuses for the problems that it cause.</p>
