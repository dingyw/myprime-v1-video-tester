      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">ANTONIO: Before we get started with Unit 2, let's run through a quick review.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: In Unit 1, we looked at the formula for lifestyle related health problems.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: We learned our biology plus our choices determine whether or not we'll develop alcoholism or addiction. Biology sets the trigger level, but our choices make the difference.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: We also learned that the definition of a standard drink is .6 ounces of pure alcohol (which is a little more than one half of an ounce).</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: The "0-1-2-3 Guidelines" for preventing health and impairment problems mean having no more than 1 drink per hour; no more than 2 daily;</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:08.00">no more than 3 drinks on any given day; and again, 0 is the only low-risk choice for those with alcoholism.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: In this unit, we're going to learn more about how our choices affect us. To get started, I'd like you to take a few minutes to answer some questions.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Now, I want to emphasize, your answers are private. And the more honest you are with yourself, the more you will benefit from this activity.</p>
