	  Thanks for completing the questions. We will come back to the answers in a little while. For now, we're going to look at four phases of alcohol and drug use. We'll describe the characteristics of each phase, which will help most people determine fairly accurately which phase they are in. 
Some people may have unknowingly made high-risk choices and come close to, or even passed their trigger level, so understanding the phases of use can be life-saving information.
It's important to keep in mind, not everyone progresses through the phases of drinking and drug use in exactly the same way. So, some people will be able to relate to everything we describe in a phase, but others might only relate to some of the experiences. Okay, let's get started.
