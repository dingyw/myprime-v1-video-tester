      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">ANTONIO: Thanks for completing the questions. We will come back to the answers in a little while. For now, we're going to look at four phases of alcohol and drug use.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: We'll describe the characteristics of each phase, which will help most people determine fairly accurately which phase they are in.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: Some people may have unknowingly made high-risk choices and come close to, or even passed their trigger level, so understanding the phases of use can be life-saving information.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: It's important to keep in mind, not everyone progresses through the phases of drinking and drug use in exactly the same way.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: So, some people will be able to relate to everything we describe in a phase, but others might only relate to some of the experiences. Okay, let's get started.</p>
