	   Remember, in order to begin changing our behavior and the choices we make, we have to plan. Action starts with the 5 key elements weâ€™ve been discussing. 1, set a date; 2, make a public statement of intent; 3, identify alternatives; 4, plan for obstacles; and 5, identify support. If we can make it through this process, we have a pretty good shot at making positive change within our lives.
