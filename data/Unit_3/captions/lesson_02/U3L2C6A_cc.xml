	   It appears you’re still thinking about whether low risk choices are right for you. It’s not uncommon for people to have mixed feelings when considering a big change. Sometimes they want to change, and sometimes they don’t. So where do we go from here?
The activities in this unit are about planning and next steps. For you, it makes sense that your planning and next steps are not about specific actions. Instead, focus on thinking about how to progress towards your goals, and how your choices can help you get there.
In other words, if I have mixed feelings, instead of simply waiting for my ambivalent feelings about low-risk choices to resolve themselves, I can actively think about what information I need. Or I can focus on specific things that must happen in order for me to move forward towards my goals. People often find this sort of active process helps keep them from getting stuck.
