      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Think of a special person in your life; someone who's important to you. And imagine a time in this person's life when there will be opportunities for drinking and drug use.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Maybe they're entering high school, going away to college, going into the military, or moving away from home.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Or, you may want to write your letter to a friend or family member who is already experiencing problems with alcohol or drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Write this letter about things you want to share with them regarding their alcohol and drug choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: My only requests are that you write your letter from the heart, and that you include at least three things you have learned in this program.</p>
