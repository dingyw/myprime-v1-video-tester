	   At this point I 'm going to ask you to do just one more activity â€“ I'd like you to take a few minutes to write a letter.
 Think of a special person in your life; someone who's important to you. And imagine a time in this person's life when there will be opportunities for drinking and drug use. Maybe they're entering high school, going away to college, going into the military, or moving away from home. Or, you may want to write your letter to a friend or family member who is already experiencing problems with alcohol or drugs.
Write this letter about things you want to share with them regarding their alcohol and drug choices. My only requests are that you write your letter from the heart, and that you include at least three things you have learned in this program.
