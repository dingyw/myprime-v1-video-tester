	   I didn’t realize it before, but I’ve affected everybody with my drinking. That kinda scares me. I don’t wanna lose you or anyone in our family because of my drinking.

	   I want you to know that anybody can get addicted, or get alcoholism. See I thought I was safe before cause I was just smoking pot, and couldn’t get addicted, but now I realize that I already had some problems.

	   The low-risk guidelines were a big surprise for me. I guess I’ve been drinking more than I realize. Growing up you must have watched your big sister engage in all these high-risk choices, but I want you to know that I see things differently now.

	   I want to thank you for the opportunity to share this program with you. It’s been a lot of work for all of us, and I hope that you’ll take from it what you need to protect the things that are most important to you in life.  Our choices carry a lot of power.
So the big questions are, “Where do you want to be in five years… and what choices will help you get there?”
