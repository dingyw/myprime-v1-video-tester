      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so let's say we've been using alcohol or drugs as a way to have fun or a while. It might be hard to imagine having a good time without them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: But eventually, our brains will change back to a more normal state and we'll be able to find pleasure in life without high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: One of the greatest things that I figured out or I learned in recovery is that that physical, that emotional craving of wanting or needing a drink, really only lasts 15 or 20 minutes, for me most of the time.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: And I've been told that that's similar for other people. Knowing that really gave me the confidence that if those cravings came up, I could really get through them, it wasn't going to be something that is tormenting me.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: And over time I've just lost the desire to drink. It's simply not there on a regular basis for me, which was something I was told happened but I never believed would. It actually has.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: Well I surrounded myself with people that drank and behaved like I did, because that's where I was comfortable.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: And when I decided that it was time for me to make a change, a major change in my life, I couldn't hang out with people who drank in the same way that I did.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: It was foreign to me as a sober person, watching the behavior. I was like, "Wow, I behaved like that, that was disturbing." And those people didn't wanna hang out with me when I stopped drinking.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: So it became pretty easy for me to stop hanging out with the friends that I used to hang out with. For a while, about 6 months, it was a pretty bleak existence.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: I spent a lot of time reading, I spent a lot of time alone in my room. And I didn't feel uncomfortable doing that, I didn't feel lonely, I kind of felt raw, a little fragile if you will.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: And then when it was time to get back there, I made new friends. I started doing stuff that was kinda outside of my comfort zone, but stuff that I wanted to do.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: I started playing in a band with some local kids in Scotland, where I was stationed, and that just opened a whole new world of people to hang out with.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: These people found fun and excitement in all different places, but they have one thing in common; they were all able reclaim fun in their lives without returning to high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Now I want to give you the opportunity to think of ways that you can do the same.</p>
