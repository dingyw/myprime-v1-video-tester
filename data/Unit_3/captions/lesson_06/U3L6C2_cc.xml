      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">ANTONIO: Okay, so let's say we've been using alcohol or drugs as a way to have fun for a while. It might be hard to imagine having a good time without them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: But eventually, our brains will change back to a more normal state and we'll be able to find pleasure in life without high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ERIC: When I stopped drinking I was really concerned with a couple things, first the I would be bored a lot and secondly that I would have to stop doing all the things I liked doing that I enjoyed and having fun.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:34.00" dur="00:00:17.00">ERIC: But really in reality being in recovery hasn't stopped me from doing any of the things I really enjoy doing. I found that you know there are a lot of things actually missing out on because I built my life around drinking.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ERIC: I can now go out to concerts and actually enjoy them and listen to music. I can go out and enjoy dinner with friends. I can go to movies.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ERIC: I'm furtunate to live in a place where I can just be outside and there is a lot to do. I read more. I am more active physically, cause I feel better. I just feel physically a lot better.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:01:19.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ERIC: And you know not drinking has really enabled me to feel closer to people so the relationships that I do have are a lot more meaningful and enjoyable than they were before when a lot of them were built around me drinking.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:33.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ROB: Well I surrounded myself with people that drank and behaved like I did, because that's where I was comfortable.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:43.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ROB: And when I decided that it was time for me to make a change, a major change in my life, I couldn't hang out with people that drank and behaved the same way that I did.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:51.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ROB: It was foreign to me as a sober person, watching the behavior. I was like, "Wow, I behaved like that, that was disturbing." And those people didn't wanna hang out with me when I stopped drinking.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:07.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ROB: So it became pretty easy to detach from the old friends that I used to hang out with. For a while, about 6 months, it was a pretty bleak existence.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:18.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ROB: I did a lot of time reading, I spent a lot of time in my room. And I was comfortable doing that, I didn't feel lonely doing that, I kind of felt raw, a little fragile if you will.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:31.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ROB: And then when I decided it was time for me to be around people again, I went and found new friends. I started doing stuff that was kinda outside of my comfort zone, but stuff that I wanted to do.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:43.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ROB: I started playing in a band with a bunch of local kids in Scotland, where I was stationed, and that just opened a whole new community of people to hang out with.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:52.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: These people found fun and excitement in all different places, but they have one thing in common; they were all able to reclaim fun in their lives without returning to high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:03:05.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Now I want to give you the opportunity to think of ways that you can do the same.</p>
