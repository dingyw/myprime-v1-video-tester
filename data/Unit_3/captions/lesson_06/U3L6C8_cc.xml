      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:03.75">ANTONIO: So, let's say I'm a sensation-seeker. What does that mean for me?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:07.00">RAY: Well, first of all, it's not a bad thing either way. Whether we're a high sensation-seeker or a low sensation-seeker, it can be a good thing.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: That makes sense.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RAY: The trick is to figure out which one we are, and then to find things to fill the needs that alcohol and drugs have met in the past. Once we do that, then we can figure out how to have fun while making low-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:23.00">ANTONIO: Okay. Let's look at some examples.</p>       
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:19.00">ROB: I wanted to be drunk, but... once I got drunk, I couldn't do anything else. It's kind of anticlimactic. Like, okay I'm hammered, now what? Throw up and go to bed, or throw up and pass out somewhere.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ROB: It really hindered the good sensation-seeking stuff. I'm an adrenaline junkie. I jump off of things, I jump out of things, I work in combat zones. And I like my life like that right now.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:02.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ROB: I just take pleasure in very simple things in my life when I'm not jumping, working, whatever. I like being by myself, I like being with small groups of friends. I like reading, I like hiking.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:18.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ROB: Solitude's really important to me. When I was drinking I didn't have that. I had to be around people all the time.</p>       
      <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:15.00">PETE: And I feel like so much of my being—of my relationships, of who I was—was the party guy, party Pete, big Pete, he likes to, he can pound beers and blow coke like nobody else.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:38.00" dur="00:00:08.00">PETE: Ya shoulda seen how much Pete did the other night, shoulda seen Pete the other night. And I feel like so much of my identity was wrapped up in that.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:46.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PETE: But again, I always come back to , I'm not an idiot, I know that I bring more to the table than that, and I always felt slighted and cheated that people were not availed of that version of me.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:16.00">PETE: So now in a lifestyle where I'm free of all that, I can do things that interest me and that I think I'm good at. I do a lot of writing, I do a lot of acting, I would have never tapped into these creative things before.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:14.00" dur="00:00:06.00">PETE: Stand-up comedy, the whole theater community. These are friends that I never...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:20.00" dur="00:00:11.00">PETE: These are doors that have swung wide open for me, that I never would have, sitting in my apartment with no power and cable, I never would have dreamed they were there for me.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:31.00" dur="00:00:13.00">PETE: I would always see these things, oh, that would be fun, I wish I could do that. And now I can do it, and I want to do it, and that's more important to me. I get to teach theater to people.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:44.00" dur="00:00:14.00">PETE: I get to stand in front of a room of 200 people and tell jokes. I get to go to my nephew's baseball game. These are things that I never would have done.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:58.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PETE: These are things I can point to and say i would have never done X, Y and Z, if I was still mired in that pit of self-loathing.</p>        
      <p begin="00:03:10.00" dur="00:00:18.00">MACKENZIE: There's definitely plenty of things that you can do to have fun without alcohol being involved. One of the greatest things I ever did was walk my feet onto a plane and climb to 13,500 feet, and jump out of it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:28.00" dur="00:00:09.00">MACKENZIE: It's the biggest rush I've ever had in my life. But there's other things, if you don't feel like skydiving is the way to go.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:37.00" dur="00:00:12.00">MACKENZIE: But it's pretty awesome going for hikes, enjoying nature, experiencing live music, taking trips, or spending time with your family.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:49.00" dur="00:00:12.00">MACKENZIE: It's so much more fun, again, to do it sober and to really absorb everything that's going on instead of having a fuzzy memory and having other people tell you how you lived your life.</p>       
      <p begin="00:04:01.00" dur="00:00:10.00">GARY: The things I do for fun these days is... I'm a guitar player, I've been playing about 30 years, and since I've been clean I've improved a whole lot.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:11.00" dur="00:00:10.00">GARY: I wasn't one of those people that thought getting high made me play better but I enjoyed it more, or at least I thought I did. I've improved a lot.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:21.00" dur="00:00:07.00">GARY: I used to play live. I've actually sat in with people like The Band and The Allman Brothers, and some really good musicians. They've actually let me sit in with them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:28.00" dur="00:00:12.00">GARY: I enjoyed that. I've kind of stopped going to concerts, that's something I miss doing, but with child support and living on your own, life's a lot more expensive now.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:40.00" dur="00:00:12.00">GARY: It's not like at the drop of the hat just do things like that. But, I play my guitar, I hang out with my friends, I still have some of my old friends but they know better, and nothing is around me when I'm with them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:52.00" dur="00:00:16.00">GARY: I have a lot of new friends. I've made some very good contacts. I have a great network of people that, as they say, if my ass is on fire, call, and I have plenty of people to do that. I just enjoy being home.</p> 
      <p begin="00:05:08.00" dur="00:00:15.00">GARY: I'm sort of boring these days, I used to be a circus, now I'm kinda the opposite. I sit at home, I watch TV, I play on my computer, strum my guitar. I'm boring these days and I like it.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:23.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PETE: Yeah... I can now actually have sex! Which is great, because that lifestyle is not conducive to a healthy sex life.</p> 
      <p begin="00:05:35.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PETE: You'll wanna have sex, a lot, you just won't be able to. Drink water and work out, and you'll be able to have more sex.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:47.00" dur="00:00:17.00">MOSES: These new activities, these new sports that I do, anywhere from running to biking to playing tennis to scuba diving to skydiving. All these factored into my life and the drinking was no more.</p> 
      <p begin="00:06:04.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MOSES: Who cares anymore? What's the point. You get so much more satisfaction from all those other things. You meet better people, you're more successful in life. Do what you want. In a better sense.</p> 
      <p begin="00:06:17.00" dur="00:00:17.00">MOSES: It's more gratifying, it's more satisfying. It's more everything, you name it. I get a much more high than I do back in the day when I was temporarily fulfilling the need with alcohol.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:34.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: So, it's as simple as finding things that are fun and exciting to do, instead of making high-risk choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:40.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: In a sense, it is that simple, and yet at the same time, there's a challenge. Remember that high-risk choices not only change how we experience fun, they also change the brain.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:51.00" dur="00:00:04.00">RAY: And sometimes these brain changes can make it more difficult to succeed.</p>
      <p begin="00:06:55.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: But it's possible...</p>
      <p begin="00:06:57.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: Absolutely. I have to get my brain working with me, instead of against me. In other words, I can use my mind to change my brain.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:05.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Okay, to learn more about this, we'll once again go to our expert on the brain and drugs, Alan Barger.</p>       
	  <p begin="00:07:12.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ALAN: You know, life is filled with pleasures...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:15.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ALAN: Family, friends, sports, hobbies, spirituality, money, travel, hot showers, good food, warm sunsets... there are too many to count.</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:26.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ALAN: These pleasures help us unwind, celebrate, or deal with stress.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:31.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALAN: Pleasure makes our lives feel rich and satisfying. Life without it would be unthinkable.</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:37.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ALAN: But when we make high-risk alcohol or drug choices, we introduce a new type of pleasure. And it feels great in the beginning, but it has a cost that others do not.</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:48.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALAN: First, we're left with a memory of a very unusual kind of pleasure, but this one has been purchased at the price of making other rewards feel less pleasurable.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:58.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ALAN: And this isn't just an impression we have. </p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:01.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALAN: Neuroscientists tell us that after an episode of high-risk alcohol or drug choices, our brain responds measurably less to other rewards.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:11.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ALAN: At first this loss of reward response lasts for a couple of days, but over time, as we make high-risk choices over and over again, it can turn into a chronic condition.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:23.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALAN: It leaves our reward system continuously drained for life's natural rewards.</p>
	  <p begin="00:08:29.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ALAN: Now our brain is rewired so it doesn't have the same response to things that used to give us pleasure, so we lose interest in them – this might be friends, jobs, school, family or other interests we once had.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:44.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ALAN: It's as if the color has been drained from our lives. The alcohol or drug becomes even more important because it starts to be our major way of unwinding, celebrating and dealing with stress.</p>
	  <p begin="00:08:56.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ALAN: In fact, our many pleasures start to shrink down to only a few, or even just one – the alcohol or drug.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:04.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ALAN: That means we have fewer ways to deal with stress, and even worse, these brain changes also make us more sensitive to stress.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:13.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ALAN: That means we want to keep on using, and life without using begins to be unthinkable. After all, this has become our main source of pleasure and who wants a life without pleasure?</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:26.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ALAN: But that's only because of our damaged response to natural rewards. The good news is these changes in our brain can be largely reversed, returning to color and many pleasures back to our lives.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:38.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ALAN: We will spend some time learning how to heal our damaged reward system, looking again at some things we used to enjoy doing or finding new ways to relax, celebrate and have fun.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:51.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALAN: This builds toward what we really wanted from our high-risk choices all along – a satisfying and pleasurable life.</p>
