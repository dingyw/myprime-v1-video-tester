	   So earlier in myPRIME, we learned that research shows that sensation seeking is a personality trait that can influence our alcohol and drug choices.

	   That’s right.

	   So, let’s say I’m a sensation seeker.  What does that mean for me if I’m trying to find new ways to have fun?

	   That’s a great question, but before we answer it, let’s take a look at a tool called the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale.  It’s commonly used in research, and it’ll give us more information about ourselves that I think will be helpful in answering that question.
