      <p begin="00:00:03.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Hey, Antonio.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: So earlier Ray, in myPRIME, we learned that research shows that sensation seeking is a personality trait that can influence our drug and alcohol choices.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: That's right.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: So, let's say I'm a sensation seeker. What does that mean if I'm trying to find new ways to have fun?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:20.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: That's a great question, but before we answer it, let's take a look at a tool called the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: It's commonly used in research, and it'll give us more information about ourselves that I think will be helpful in answering that question.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Okay. You can click on the link if you'd like to learn whether you are high or low on sensation-seeking.</p>
