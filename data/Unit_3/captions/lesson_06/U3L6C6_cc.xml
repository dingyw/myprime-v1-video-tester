	   Hey, Antonio.

        ANTONIO: 
        
	   So earlier in myPRIME, we learned that research shows that sensation seeking is a personality trait that can influence our alcohol and drug choices.

      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        RAY:
        
	   That's right. 
      </p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        ANTONIO: 
        
	   So, let's say I'm a sensation seeker. What does that mean for me if I'm trying to find new ways to have fun?

      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">
        RAY: 
        
	   That's a great question, but before we answer it, let's take a look at a tool called the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale. It's commonly used in research, and it'll give us more information about ourselves that I think will be helpful in answering that question.

	   Okay. You can click on the link if you'd like to learn whether you are high or low on sensation-seeking.
