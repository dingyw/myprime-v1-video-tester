	   At the beginning of this lesson, we heard several people describe their fear of not being able to have fun anymore. But in time, they were able to find new things that brought them a lot of pleasure. 
If a person started making high-risk choices at a young age, they may have never developed ways of relaxing without alcohol or drugs.  So when they think of something fun they did before they started making high-risk choices, it may seem like “kid stuff,” because it was. 
If we have this experience, it tells us that our recreation is tied up in state dependent activities, and that we’ll need to learn some new ways to have fun without high-risk choices. 
Other people may want to return to old hobbies or ways or relaxing.  However, at first, they may find these activities to be less rewarding because of changes in the brain, and the need to relearn rusty skills. But if they stick with it, the fun will return.
Life has so much to offer. Hopefully you’ve thought about some activities you once enjoyed that you’d like return to, or considered some new things you’d like to try.
