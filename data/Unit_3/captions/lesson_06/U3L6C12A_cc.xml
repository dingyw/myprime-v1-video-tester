	   We've seen how high-risk alcohol or drug use can alter our brains, leaving us with less pleasure and more stress. But, there are additional concerns for those making high-risk choices in their teenage or young-adult years. Ray, can you tell us a little bit more about this.

        RAY: 
        
	   Sure. 
To understand this additional risk, we need to have a little background on brain development. At around the age of 12, the brain begins to go through a massive redesign. This generally starts in the back of the brain, and works its way forward to the front. 
By the time a person is in their late teens and young adult years, most of this brain development is finished, but not all of it. These changes continue until sometime in the mid-twenties. 
So, why is this important? Let's look more closely. 
The last part of the brain to go through this reshaping is the prefrontal cortex, which is located right behind the eyes. The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive brain functions. It's the part of the brain that gives us the ability do adult thing...
No... not sex. Adult things like prioritizing what's important, planning, organizing, and sticking to a task until it's done. It's what allows us to control our emotions, evaluate ourselves, and -- when necessary -- change our behavior. 
Think about itâ€”children don't do these things very well. Teenagers tend to do them better than children. And adults are usually even better at them than teenagers. This is because the adult prefrontal cortex is more developed. 
The high-risk use of alcohol or drugs can slow this development, leaving people stuck in adolescent ways of responding even as they move into their adult years. They may be less able to control their emotions, less able to prioritize, plan, or delay gratification now to get better long-term rewards later. 
It's not that they cannot do these things, but they have to work harder at them, and they may fail more often. It's ironic; young people may be pulled into making high-risk choices, thinking it's what adults do. But high-risk choices can prevent people from developing adult ways of responding to life's challenges. 
Compound that slowed development with the loss of pleasure, and increased stress, and it can lead people into a pattern of high-risk choices that increase the risk for addiction and other problems.
So if we've been making high-risk choices, now can be a good time to consciously use our best thinking to re-evaluate what we've been doing, and where we want to go from here. But because of these brain changes, we may have to work harder than most, to do that. 
Good intentions are not enough to succeed in making a change. This may be particularly true for alcohol and drugs. We've just learned that high-risk choices change our brain. So, if we want to succeed... once we change our mind, we must also change our brain.
