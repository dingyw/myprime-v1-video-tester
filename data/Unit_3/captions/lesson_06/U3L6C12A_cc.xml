      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:06.75">ANTONIO: We've seen how high-risk alcohol or drug use can alter our brains, leaving us with less pleasure and more stress.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: But, there are additional concerns for those making high-risk choices in their teenage or young-adult years. Ray, can you tell us a little bit more about this.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:16.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: Sure. To understand this additional risk, we need to have a little background on brain development. At around the age of 12, the brain begins to go through a massive redesign.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:05.00">RAY: This generally starts in the back of the brain, and works its way forward to the front.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:31.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: By the time a person is in their late teens and young adult years, most of this brain development is finished, but not all of it.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:39.00" dur="00:00:07.00">RAY: These changes continue until sometime in the mid-twenties. So, why is this important? Let's look more closely.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: The last part of the brain to go through this reshaping is the prefrontal cortex, which is located right behind the eyes.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: The prefrontal cortex is responsible for executive brain functions. It's the part of the brain that gives us the ability do adult things...</p>
      <p begin="00:01:05.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: No... not sex. Adult things like prioritizing what's important, planning, organizing, and sticking to a task until it's done.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:15.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: It's what allows us to control our emotions, evaluate ourselves, and -- when necessary -- change our behavior.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:24.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: Think about itâ€”children don't do these things very well. Teenagers tend to do them better than children.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:30.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: And adults are usually even better at them than teenagers. This is because the adult prefrontal cortex is more developed.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:39.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: The high-risk use of alcohol or drugs can slow this development, leaving people stuck in adolescent ways of responding even as they move into their adult years.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:49.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RAY: They may be less able to control their emotions, less able to prioritize, plan, or delay gratification now to get better long-term rewards later.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:00.00" dur="00:00:14.00">RAY: It's not that they cannot do these things, but they have to work harder at them, and they may fail more often. It's ironic; young people may be pulled into making high-risk choices, thinking it's what adults do.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:14.00" dur="00:00:07.00">RAY: But high-risk choices can prevent people from developing adult ways of responding to life's challenges.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:21.00" dur="00:00:13.00">RAY: Compound that slowed development with the loss of pleasure, and increased stress, and it can lead people into a pattern of high-risk choices that increase the risk for addiction and other problems.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:34.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: If we've been making high-risk choices, this could be a time to use our best thinking to re-evaluate what we've been doing, and where we want to go from here.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:44.00" dur="00:00:05.00">RAY: But because of these brain changes, we may have to work harder than most, to do that.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:49.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RAY: Good intentions aren't enough to succeed in making a change. This may be particularly true for alcohol and drugs. We've just learned that high-risk choices change our brain.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:01.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: So, if we want to succeed... once we change our mind, we must also change our brain.</p>
