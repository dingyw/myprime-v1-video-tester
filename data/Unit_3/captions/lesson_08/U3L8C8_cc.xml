	   Success comes in small steps and each one is worth recognizing and celebrating is some way. Sometimes it’s the pride of setting a setting a goal and meeting it. Other times it’s a small indulgence like our favorite ice cream. Or, it might be taking the money we have saved with our new choices and doing something special.
Change is hard…so you’ve got to celebrate your successes.
