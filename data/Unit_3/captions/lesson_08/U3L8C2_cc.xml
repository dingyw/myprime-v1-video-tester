	   What are some ways I can reward myself for making low-risk choices? One thing I could do is consistently put aside the money that I would have spent on alcohol or drugs. After a while, I’ll have enough money saved to buy myself something I’ve been wanting. One Prime for Life student did just that, and he eventually was able buy a pickup truck with the money he saved when he stopped buying beer, and started making low-risk choices. If monetary rewards are not as motivating, what other rewards would work for you? People often find they have free time that used to be spending drinking, or using. They might reward themselves by taking a special trip or spending more time with family.
