      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:06.75">ANTONIO: Setting goals and planning for rewards in our future is a great way to motivate ourselves to make low-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:07.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ANTONIO: But aside from the obvious appeal of being able to accomplish something or purchase something we've always wanted, why is rewarding ourselves for making low-risk choices so important? Let's find out.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALAN: Making change can be difficult, and sometimes all the work we do to maintain can seem hard or boring.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALAN: Fortunately, the human brain is wired to respond to rewards, and we can use that by planning ways to reward ourselves for sticking to our new choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ALAN: Rewarding ourselves isn't just a motivational gimmick... it has an important biological benefit.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:44.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ALAN: When we reward ourselves with positive things, such as doing something fun, or buying something we've saved for, our brains respond by giving us positive feelings.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ALAN: So, if we reward ourselves for making low-risk choices, our lives will feel more satisfying.</p>
