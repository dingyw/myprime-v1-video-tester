      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Setting goals and planning for rewards in our future is a great way to motivate ourselves in making low-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: But aside from the obvious appeal of being able to do something or to purchase something we've wanted, what are some things that make low-risk choices so important?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALAN: Making change can be difficult, and sometimes all the work we need to do to maintain it seems hard, or boring.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALAN: Fortunately, the human brain is wired to respond to rewards, and we can use that by planning ways to reward ourselves for sticking to our new choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALAN: Rewarding ourselves isn't just a motivational gimmick... it has an important biological benefit.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALAN: When we reward ourselves with positive things, such as volunteering, or buying something we've saved for, our brains respond the same way as they do when making high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ALAN: So, if we reward ourselves for making low-risk choices, the impact on the brain is similar to the good feeling we get from making high risk choices.</p>
