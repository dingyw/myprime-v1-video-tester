	   No one wants to lose things they value; I know I sure don't. And no one consciously chooses to lose them. But it still happens. 
Think back again to the values activity from the beginning of the program— it was really hard to even just imagine losing the important things in our lives. 
We all make choices every day—some of these choices protect our values, and others risk them.
Remember the wolf story? Well, every time we make a choice about alcohol or drugs, we're feeding either the wolf that protects us, or the wolf that destroys us. 
The problem is we're not usually thinking about risks, or what we could lose. More times than not, we just react to situations without thinking about the consequences. 
But if we want to protect our values, we can't just react; we've got to think about what's important to us, and think about what we want for our future. When we can do that we can empower ourselves to make better choices.
