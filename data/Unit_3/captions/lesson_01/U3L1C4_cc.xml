      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: No one wants to lose things they value; I know I sure don't. And no one consciously chooses to lose them. But it still happens.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Think back again to the values activity from the beginning of the program— it was really hard to even just imagine losing the important things in our lives.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: We all make choices every day—some of these choices protect our values, and others risk them.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Remember the wolf story? Well, every time we make a choice about alcohol or drugs, we're feeding either the wolf that protects us, or the wolf that destroys us.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: The problem is we're not usually thinking about risks, or what we could lose. More times than not, we just react to situations without thinking about the consequences.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: But if we want to protect our values, we can't just react; we've got to think about what's important to us, and think about what we want for our future.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: When we can do that we can empower ourselves to make better choices.</p>
