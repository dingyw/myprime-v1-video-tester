	   Remember, when we find ourselves wanting to give in and make high-risk choices—this is normal. 
We may experience anxiety and as a result, we may feel pressured to give in because it seems easier…at first. 
But we now have some ammunition in our back pocket—we’re prepared to respond to this anxiety and to face those challenges head on.
