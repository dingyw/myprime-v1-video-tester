      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so we've done a lot of talking about big picture planning and long-term outcomes. It's important to look at the big picture, but it can also be helpful to concentrate on our day-to-day lives.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So, Ray—let's talk about how everyday circumstances can affect the choices we make.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Sure Antonio. You know how sometimes we get in certain circumstances in which we really want to make high-risk choices?</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: If we've already made the decision that we want to start making low-risk choices, then that desire can create anxiety. And our brains have learned to interpret anxiety as a cue to use alcohol and drugs.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So that makes things even harder. The feeling we get when we want to use alcohol or drugs... makes us want to use alcohol or drugs even more.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Exactly. And we can begin to feel like we're failing and want to give up. In reality though, this is an important step in rewiring our brains and returning them to normal.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: How so?</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Well, everyone feels uncomfortable sometimes. That's natural. What's most important is how we respond to the anxiety.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So it's an opportunity to make the choice we want to make.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Exactly. By preparing for these situations, we give ourselves the opportunity to act on our commitment to low-risk choices—even when it's difficult.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Every time we do that, it rewires our brains just a little bit, so that over time it gets easier.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, let's look at some ways people have prepared themselves to face these difficult situations.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">LISA: Things for me that would set the cravings off, the biggest things were smells. Like, if you drive by a construction site and that nasty drywall smell would set it off in my head, and I don't know why.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">LISA: It would make me very very shaky and I would have to get away from it as soon as possible, because then I wanna pick up my phone, and go through my phone and call those people that were a very big part of my life when I was doing this.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">LISA: So, I mean, it literally gave me anxiety, to the point where I had to be treated for anxiety. That's what those cravings were like.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">LISA: They were awful. As time has went by—that was 7 years ago when I stopped—so as time has gone by, it's progressively gotten better, where I still have the cravings once in a while, but they're not as strong as they used to be.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: Shortly after I stopped drinking I met a person who became a mentor for me.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: And that person said a few things to me, but one of the things they said to me was that they had been in recovery for a number of years, and they no longer had a desire to drink, and that could happen for me too.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: I thought that was bullshit, I thought that was some pie-in-the-sky stuff. But it's really turned out to be true for me.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ERIC: If I could say that to someone else who has made a decision not to drink, and struggling through getting day-to-day through it, it does get better, and that can happen for them too.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">CAROLINE: I found it very difficult to watch games, because the emotions were so strong. But I did watch a couple, and I did go to a couple game, but really just laughing about things.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">CAROLINE: I found that as a tool for me along the way to laugh instead of cry, when given the options, when things are just overwhelming to me. To just laugh about it. Or cry. But laughter's pretty good medicine.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">CAROLINE: Some social situations, say birthday parties or whatever, it might be a cocktail reception before an event. Having to be "on," to look good, to sound good.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">CAROLINE: Having to be in that kind of a situation, where eyes will be on me, that would be a highly—an anxiety provoking moment—where as before I would self-medicate that anxiety. But now, I don't do that, I feel it.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">CAROLINE: And the more times I'm able to feel it and not use, it reinforces the behavior. It changes the conditions if that makes sense.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">CAROLINE: I guess having a little bit of courage, to believe in myself, to believe in whatever else it is that's out there, that I can do something different.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: I would never cheapen or discount anybody else's ways to not drink. Some people make a list, some people drive themselves to a party.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: Me, I was taught the phrase, "Play my tape." If I play my tape ahead, I know where that drink is gonna lead me. It's gonna lead to 2 drinks, to 4 drinks, to 8 drinks, to a phone call, to a bag of coke, to two days.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: And then I'm gonna feel like crap about that. And knowing that my coping skills are less than adequate, what am I gonna do to not feel like crap? I'm gonna probably drink again.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: And then I'm gonna be back in that cycle. So if those things work for those people, fine. I just like to play my tape, remember where I've been, what I've been through, and know that I don't wanna go back there again.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: All this respect that I've garnered from people, all these creative things that I've been able to tap into, that's all gonna be gone, quick fast and in a hurry, if I pick up that drink.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: I just have to think of the consequences, remember how I felt that day when I was talking to my siblings, and know that I'd be right back there.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: For me one of my major cravings was the smell of a match. Matches burning, or credit cards...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: I did a lot of hotel use, using in hotels, so little memorabilias from hotel, little matches or notepads, these were all tips for me. For a while, money was a clue for me.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: If I had too much money I was gonna get into trouble. If I had too much money, I would start thinking about all the things I could do with the drug. That was another dangerous one for me.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: And also sex, sex was one, because during that period of using drugs like that, oftentimes I associated sex with it. You thought the sex was better with this or better with that.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE:  And so I had to kind of wean myself off of a lot of things, and just try to live right.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Sometimes people fall back on their old choices because they weren't prepared for a situation. So it's important to be prepared.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Or maybe they just didn't know what to say.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: That brings up a good point-- whether we're going to reduce our use or stop altogether, we've got to be able to say "no" in a way that's comfortable.
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Sometimes, it's "no, no more," and for other times it's, "no, none" but in either case we've got to have the words that fit our new choice in an old situation.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Okay, so let's do an exercise to help you prepare. Here's a chance for you to get ready, be ready, and be quick when those situations come up.</p>
