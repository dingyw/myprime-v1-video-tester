      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:03.75">ANTHONY: They've asked me to go out to bars with them, and stuff like that, and I've said, "nah, I don't feel like drinking today."</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:04.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTHONY: And they'll be like, "Aww, quite being a pussy," or "Come on, let's go out, you can't be a barracks rat." Or something.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTHONY: "Nah, I just don't feel like gettin' trashed, wasting money."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTHONY: They can call me whatever they want, I don't care. I just don't feel like drinking, they can say whatever they want.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTHONY: I don't let what people say bother me too much, I just could care less. People are gonna talk.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:29.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTHONY: It's not really that bad, they're usually just joking around with me. It's just part of being with a bunch of other dudes I guess.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:38.00" dur="00:00:18.00">BRAD: Spending time with people in my social network, calling family, checking in on a regular basis, just filling my schedule with positive activities.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:56.00" dur="00:00:14.00">BRAD: Working out was really important. For me, what was especially important was being able to get through periods of depression, and realizing that I could make it through that without picking up.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:17.00">BRAD: If I'd had a rough week... My mood won't be the same forever, eventually it'll pass. So just kind of being patient, being able to sit with that. I've found certain practices of meditation helpful.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:27.00" dur="00:00:18.00">CAROLINE: When in drinking or using environments, I like the answers to, "Would you like a drink?" of "Thanks, I've had enough," or "I've had my share. Thank you." Or, "I'm allergic, I break out in handcuffs."</p>
      <p begin="00:01:45.00" dur="00:00:11.00">GARY: It's having an escape plan. Never get... always have my car with me. This way, if they do start getting high and I just can't be around it, get up and go.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:56.00" dur="00:00:06.00">GARY: Have an escape plan. As they say, if your ass is on fire, make a phone call.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:11.00">GARY: To me that's the number 1 thing, to have an escape plan. If you need to get out of there, get out of there. If you stay, you're gonna take it eventually.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:13.00" dur="00:00:14.00">CAROLINE: Prayer, meditation, going for a walk. Move a muscle, change a thought. I didn't stop moving very much, especially the first year. I don't know if I've stopped moving yet.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:27.00" dur="00:00:20.00">CAROLINE: I just go. I think a lot of exercise, picking up the phone, calling someone, asking for help. Being open, honest, and willing. That's the "HOW" of my recovery.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:47.00" dur="00:00:10.00">CAROLINE: Honesty, H, openmindedness, O, and willingness, is the W. So, HOW. That's how.</p>
      <p begin="00:02:57.00" dur="00:00:05.00">MIKAEL: Sometimes I do avoid places like that.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:02.00" dur="00:00:18.00">MIKAEL: When I can't avoid it, I give myself opportunities to excuse myself if it becomes too much, whether it's just walking outside, whether it's walking outside and calling somebody just to talk to.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:20.00" dur="00:00:17.00">MIKAEL: But as time goes on, as well, I use it as a learning experience. I don't want to have to avoid life.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:37.00" dur="00:00:15.00">MIKAEL: Early on, as I was just getting sober, I didn't do this, but now it's like, this is an opportunity where I need to learn how to be amongst people and not drink.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:52.00" dur="00:00:19.00">MIKAEL: If it's a cocktail hour or happy hour or party, that's fine, if it's some sort of occasion where people are just getting blasted, I just don't need to be there. It's no fun for me anyways.</p>
	  <p begin="00:04:11.00" dur="00:00:09.00">MIKAEL: I have to be honest with myself as far as what's good for me—do I need to be there?</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:20.00" dur="00:00:21.00">MIKAEL: If so, a lot of it comes down to just being easy with myself, not expecting myself to be the life of the party, not expecting myself to be able to converse with everybody.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:41.00" dur="00:00:13.00">MIKAEL: A lot of it's just getting control of my own anxiety in situations like that, and going easy on myself.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:54.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RACHEL: I tried to change my people, places, and things. I drank at the end. I was home in my kitchen at 5 o'clock. I actually just tried to change my patterns.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:06.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RACHEL: My goal was always to be home at 5 o'clock so I could start drinking. I had to somehow be more a little bit laid back, I guess.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:16.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RACHEL: If the kids wanted to go to the movie in the middle of the afternoon, that's OK! It didn't matter when I got home. I just tried to change habits, patterns, people.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:27.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RACHEL: It's not always easy. Sometimes we're in a situation where we have very little control of how we're going to do it.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:38.00" dur="00:00:12.00">KIRBY: A few other tools that I would use to stop making high-risk choices and to be a little safer with how I behaved.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:50.00" dur="00:00:22.00">KIRBY: I would try to spend time with friends who didn't drink as much, or even if they did drink, didn't black out, or didn't make these decisions to get into a car, or to go out and get into trouble in other ways.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:12.00" dur="00:00:09.00">KIRBY: That was helpful, to just talk to people like that and spend time with people like that.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:21.00" dur="00:00:25.00">KIRBY: I also realized I wanted to remember the fun that I was having at that time in my life, and not impede that with alcohol, and not just kind of drink myself into oblivion.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:46.00" dur="00:00:09.00">KIRBY: It was also helpful to just make a decision to leave the party earlier, and know that I could get home safely, and just to think about the next day, the next week,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:05.00" dur="00:00:09.00">and how I was going to feel the next morning, instead of just living in the moment and thinking about getting another drink.</p>
      <p begin="00:07:14.00" dur="00:00:07.00">GEORGE: Here's some things that worked for me and could possibly work for you, and I learned this in the program:</p>
      <p begin="00:07:21.00" dur="00:00:14.00">GEORGE: Don't get to hungry, don't get too angry, don't get too lonely, don't get too tired. It's an acronym for HALT. My addiction and most addiction is built on feelings.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:35.00" dur="00:00:06.00">GEORGE: I didn't get too far into my feelings, I would always reach out to someone else.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:41.00" dur="00:00:08.00">GEORGE: That's a good tip—reach out, pick up the phone, and call somebody. Let somebody know what your going through because somebody else has been through that same situation.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:49.00" dur="00:00:11.00">GEORGE: And I don't allow myself to get isolated, I'm not gonna be alone too long, have someone with me so when my behavior changes, they can look at me and say, "Hey, what's going on with you?"</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:00.00" dur="00:00:11.00">GEORGE: And I learned to communicate with people, no matter how tough it is. I find somebody, somewhere that I can tell exactly what's going on with me.</p>
