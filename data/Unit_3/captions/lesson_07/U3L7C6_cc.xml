	   Having a plan in place can help us overcome a state dependent learning skill. But what if we are in relationships that are state-dependent, like friendships or romantic relationships? Once again, we'll go to Ray.

	   When a friendship or relationship is formed around alcohol or drug use it's possible for the relationship itself to become state dependent. When we use we feel closer and have more fun. It might be hard to imagine even being together without using. And when we remove the alcohol or drugs we may find the relationship is no longer fulfilling or that the person is no longer fun to be with.
But, If both people in the relationship are committed to changing their alcohol or drug use, and are committed to the relationship, it can work; we just need to rediscover each other soberâ€”in a way treat it like a new relationship.

	   Thanks, Ray. So, once we become aware that a skill, or set of skills, has become state dependent, we can put a plan in place to re-learn it without making high-risk choices. 
It might take a lot of practice, and patience, but it will get better if we keep making low-risk choices. Think of it as making an investment in our relationships, our future, and ourselves.
