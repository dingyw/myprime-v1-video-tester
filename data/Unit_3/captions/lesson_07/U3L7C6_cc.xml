      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">ANTONIO: Having a plan in place can help us overcome a state dependent learning skill.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: But what if we are in relationships that are state-dependent, like friendships or romantic relationships? Once again, we'll go to Ray.</p>        
      <p begin="00:00:14.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: When a friendship or relationship is formed around alcohol or drug use it's possible for the relationship itself to become state dependent.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: This means when we use we feel closer and have more fun. It might be hard to imagine even being together without using.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: And when we remove the alcohol or drugs we may find the relationship is no longer fulfilling or that the person is no longer fun to be with.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:41.00" dur="00:00:09.00">RAY: But, If both people in the relationship are committed to changing their alcohol or drug use, and are committed to the relationship, it can work;</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:06.00">they just need to rediscover each other soberâ€”almost like it's a new relationship.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:56.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: Thanks, Ray. So, once we become aware that a skill, or set of skills, has become state dependent, we can put a plan in place to re-learn it without making high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:14.00">ANTONIO: It might take a lot of practice, and patience, but it will get better if we keep making low-risk choices. Think of it as making an investment in our relationships, our future, and ourselves.</p>
