      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:11.75">ANTONIO: Earlier in the program we talked about state dependent learning. When we learn something while making high-risk choices, we're most comfortable and best at it when we return to that blood alcohol (or drug) level.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:12.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: This makes us more likely to make high-risk choices when we need to use that skill.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:18.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Social skills often become state-dependent because we are likely to learn and use these skills at places where we're making high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:27.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: And if we have a lot of state-dependent learning, it can almost start to feel like we're two different people.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: But we can overcome state dependent learning by practicing these skills while abstaining from alcohol and drugs, or making low-risk choices.</p>        
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:13.00">JEREMY: When I was at bars, I wouldn't do things unless I was drinking, if I'd volunteered to be the DD. There were certain things... I wouldn't be as conversational; I'd be off in the corner.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:08.00">JEREMY: I started realizing that now, it did take me alcohol to get out on the dance floor and stuff.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:09.00">JEREMY: And like I was telling ya'll, the other night I went out with a buddy and I had one beer, and I was still going out and dancing, and having a great time, </p> 
      <p begin="00:01:12.00" dur="00:00:10.00">and actually asking women to come out, which was weird for me, because I'd never done that if I was sober. I always depended upon that alcohol for me to have a good time.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:22.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ROB: I don't think it's re-learning... I never learned things in the first place! I started drinking when I was 13. From 13-18, that's a big development time for people.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:34.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ROB: And when I stopped drinking I just didn't know how to do stuff, I didn't know how to behave without drinking, I didn't know how to behave around people. It was just kind of a learning process.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:45.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ROB: I'd just kinda go and observe. Sit in the corner for a little while, 'til I started feeling comfortable, then I'd venture out of my shell. So it's not re-learning, I was learning, it's an initial learning process for me.</p>     
      <p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:13.00">DONALD: ...I wanna do better for my family, my friends, my true friends, because the people that you deal with, you sit there and hang out with aren't always your friends.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:11.00" dur="00:00:10.00">DONALD: They weren't always my friends. I didn't realize it at the time that I was in the situation, but I finally realized that they weren't really my friends.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:21.00" dur="00:00:10.00">DONALD: They were gonna find somebody else that was gonna do the things that I was doing for them. And it was hard. It was hard to just drop them, just to more or less...</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:31.00" dur="00:00:07.00">DONALD: ...It's not to say that when I see them in the streets I don't say what's up, how are you doin', but I just don't deal with them anymore.</p> 
      <p begin="00:02:38.00" dur="00:00:13.00">DONALD: I stopped dealing with them, and that made it a lot easier to not do the things I was doing before, and get myself to be in the right frame of mind to be on my track.</p>        
      <p begin="00:02:51.00" dur="00:00:12.00">MIKAEL: Yeah, I wanted to create a life for myself. The arts and creativity is very important to me.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:03.00" dur="00:00:29.00">MIKAEL: I started to lean on alcohol more and more... sort of, to be the catalyst and source for me to be creative, and I eventually started to depend on it so much that it... The two went hand in hand.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:32.00" dur="00:00:20.00">MIKAEL: And one of the things when I got sober that I had to challenge myself with was, if I was creative, if I was truely creative, if I was so damn creative that I should be able to create a life without drugs and alcohol.</p> 
      <p begin="00:03:52.00" dur="00:00:10.00">MIKAEL: And I've had to consistently challenge myself to that even after I was sober, because I still go through periods where I just feel like in a funk.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:02.00" dur="00:00:08.00">MIKAEL: And I have to talk to other artists, other people in recovery that are also artists, and I have to lean on them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:10.00" dur="00:00:14.00">MIKAEL: Sometimes it's just a validation that you can't always be "on." You can't always be at you maximum output. That's just the way it is, it's all about ebb and flow.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:24.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Now, we'll hear from Ray Daugherty about how we can overcome state-dependent learning.</p>        
      <p begin="00:04:30.00" dur="00:00:10.00">RAY: The only way to overcome state dependent learning is to practice, or re-learn the skill without making high-risk choices. But to do that, we need to make a plan.</p>
      <p begin="00:04:40.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RAY: For example, if dancing is state dependent, we may identify a person we can dance with, and not be embarrassed while we're re-learning. That person can be a friend or family member, or a total stranger.</p> 
      <p begin="00:04:52.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: Once we identify that person, as well as a time and place to dance, then we need to practice until we've regained the skill.</p>
      <p begin="00:05:00.00" dur="00:00:11.00">RAY: Sometimes we need to identify alternatives. For example, if relaxing is state dependent, then we need to find another way to relax other than drinking or using drugs.</p> 
      <p begin="00:05:11.00" dur="00:00:08.00">RAY: Some examples might be listening to music, picking up a hobby, or learning relaxation techniques.</p>
