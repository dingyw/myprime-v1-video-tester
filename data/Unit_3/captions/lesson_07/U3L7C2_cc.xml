	   Earlier in the program we talked about state dependent learning. When we learn something while making high-risk choices, we're most comfortable and best at it when we return to that blood alcohol (or drug) level. This makes us more likely to make high-risk choices when we need to use that skill. 
Social skills often become state-dependent because we are likely to learn and use these skills at places where we're making high-risk choices. And if we have a lot of state-dependent learning, it can almost start to feel like we're two different people. But we can overcome state dependent learning by practicing these skills while abstaining from alcohol and drugs, or making low-risk choices.

	   When I was at bars, I wouldn't do things unless I'd started drinking, if I'd volunteered to be the DD. There were certain things... I wouldn't be as conversational; I'd be off in the corner. I realize that now, it did take me alcohol to get out on the dance floor the other night. And like I told you guys before, the other night I went out and had one beer, and was actually out on the dance floor, and asking women to come out, which was weird for me, because I'd never done that sober. I always depended on alcohol to have a good time.

	   I don't think it's re-learning... I never learned things in the first place! I started drinking when I was 13. From 13-18, that's a big development time for people. And when I stopped drinking I didn't know how to behave without drinking, I didn't know how to behave around people. It was just kind of a learning process. I'd just kinda go and observe. Sit in the corner for a little while, 'til I started feeling comfortable, then I'd venture out of my shell. So it's not re-learning, it's an initial learning process for me.

	   I wanna do better for my family, my friends, my true friends, because the people you sit there and hang out with aren't always your friends. I didn't realize it at the time that I was in the situation, but I finally realized that they weren't really my friends. They were gonna find somebody else that was gonna do the things that I was doing for them. And it was hard. It was hard to just drop them, just to more or less... It's not to say that when I see them in the streets I don't say what's up, how are you doin', but I just don't deal with them anymore. I stopped dealing with them, and that made it a lot easier to not do the things I was doing before, and get myself to be in the right state of mind to be on my track.

	   Yeah, I wanted to create a life for myself. The arts and creativity is very important to me. I started to lean on alcohol more and more to be the catalyst and source for me to be creative, and I eventually started to depend on it so much that it... The two went hand in hand. One of the things when I got sober that I had to challenge myself with was, if I was too creative, if I was so creative that I should be able to create a life without drugs and alcohol. And I've had to consistently challenge myself as I'm sober, because I still go through periods where I'm kind of in a funk. I have to talk to other artists, other people in recovery that are also artists, and I have to lean on them. Sometimes it's just a validation that you can't always be "on." You can't always be at you maximum output. That's just the way it is, it's all about ebb and flow.

	   Now, we'll hear from Ray Daugherty about how we can overcome state-dependent learning.

        RAY:
        
	   The only way to overcome state dependent learning is to practice, or re-learn the skill without making high-risk choices. But to do that, we need to make a plan.
For example, if dancing is state dependent, we may identify a person we can dance with, and not be embarrassed while we're re-learning. That person can be a friend or family member, or a total stranger. Once we identify that person, as well as a time and place to dance, then we need to practice until we've regained the skill.
Sometimes we need to identify alternatives. For example, if relaxing is state dependent, then we need to find another way to relax other than drinking or using drugs. Some examples might be listening to music, picking up a hobby, or learning relaxation techniques.
