	   We've learned about our own level of biological risk, and we've learned what choices are low-risk. We've identified what outcomes we want, and what choices we're willing to make to get those outcomes. 
When it comes to our new choices we may face challenges, but we're aware of the support around and within us. And we're aware how powerful our internal resources are. This awareness gives us the tools we need to get the outcomes we want.
But we still want to have fun. What about making sure we're still having fun? We're going to talk about that next.
