     <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:04.75">ANTONIO: You've probably heard the saying "I think I can, I think I can ..."</p> 
     <p begin="00:00:05.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Well, it illustrates an important point about change: Thinking affects our choices and every choice affects our success.</p> 
     <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: Research shows that believing we can succeed actually increases our odds of success. And one thing that helps give us that confidence is a plan that reflects who we are and what we want.</p>
	 <p begin="00:00:26.00" dur="00:00:14.00">PETE: In my experience, when I made this decision to change my lifestyle, the idea of not drinking--specifically not drinking, the not doing cocaine was easier for me to accept--but not drinking?</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:40.00" dur="00:00:09.00">PETE: Drinking is legal, and everybody does it, so it's harder to make the decision to not do it. I'm like, I'm never gonnabe able to drink again.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:07.00">PETE: That is like standing at the base of the Matterhorn. That's an unrealistic goal to me, to sit there and say that.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:00:56.00" dur="00:00:10.00">PETE: And I think that's why people say, "One day at a time," or whatever, because that's a more manageable goal. It's kinda cliche, but that's something I can actually do.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:01:06.00" dur="00:00:15.00">PETE: Sure, I can go until the sun goes down, and then when the sun goes down I can go until I go to bed. These are manageable goals for me. So, after a while those days add up, and it's just the way it is.</p>
	 <p begin="00:01:21.00" dur="00:00:07.00">CAROLINE: Things happened beyond my wildest dreams. I don't get to plan this necessarily.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:14.00">CAROLINE: I can have hopes and I can have dreams, then if I just let go, and do the right things for the right reasons, and show up, then just amazing things have happened.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:01:42.00" dur="00:00:03.00">CAROLINE: And I got a raise!</p> 
	 <p begin="00:01:45.00" dur="00:00:17.00">CAROLINE: One thing I noticed immediately once I quit using and had clean eyes so to speak, when people used, they didn't get prettier, they didn't get happier, they didn't get richer, they didn't get smarter...</p>
	 <p begin="00:02:02.00" dur="00:00:14.00">CAROLINE: More on the opposite line. So where I was, at least I go in the direction that I hoped to go in, rather than have something controlling me, and holding me back, which is what drugs and alcohol did.</p>
	 <p begin="00:02:16.00" dur="00:00:16.00">KIRBY: You know, that change was difficult, but it was helpful to think back and remember the feeling of those consequences from those high-risk choices,</p> 
	 <p begin="00:02:32.00" dur="00:00:12.00">and just remember how awful that made my feel, and how disappointed my family was in me, and how, how scary it was.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:02:44.00" dur="00:00:15.00">KIRBY: That became helpful in the day-to-day thing when you're thinking, "Well tonight I'll have ten drinks," or something like that.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:02:59.00" dur="00:00:13.00">KIRBY: It was helpful to think back and to re-experience those consequences, or just think about those consequences again.</p>
	 <p begin="00:03:12.00" dur="00:00:15.00">RACHEL: I just find that the strength, now, of being sober, is—and I have a lot of weaknesses, of character, and some other things and just being silly and goofy—</p> 
	 <p begin="00:03:27.00" dur="00:00:08.00">but the empowerment of just being able to know that I have done something that is good for myself.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:03:35.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RACHEL: There's always that stigma of, "You're an alcoholic," or "You're a drug addict."</p> 
	 <p begin="00:03:41.00" dur="00:00:14.00">RACHEL: And there are people in this world to whom I'll always be an alcoholic—but there are more people in this world in my life that I'm a recovering alcoholic, and they are proud of me, and I am proud of that.</p>  
	 <p begin="00:03:55.00" dur="00:00:25.00">RACHEL: And so that to me is really important. To know that it's ok. It's ok to be out there, it's okay to be quiet about it. But the power behind it, and honoring the people in my life, being present, is now sweet and tangible.</p>
	 <p begin="00:04:20.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: You have just heard some examples of how people overcame their challenges and relied on their internal resources. Now it's your turn.</p> 
	 <p begin="00:04:30.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Take a few minutes to answer the following questions about your internal resources. We all have them... but sometimes we don't really appreciate them.</p>
