        <br/>
	   Remember, in order to begin changing our behaviors and the choices we make, we have to plan. And a plan of action starts with the five key elements that weâ€™ve been discussing; 
One: set a date. <br />
Two: make a public statement of intent.<br />
Three: Identify alternatives. <br />
Four: Plan for obstacles.<br />
And, five: Identify support.<br />
If we can make it through this process we have a pretty good shot of making a positive change in our lives.
