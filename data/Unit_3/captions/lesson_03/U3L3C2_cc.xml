      <p begin="00:00:00.13" dur="00:00:12.75">ANTONIO: In this next lesson we are going to look at what we need to do to prepare for success. If we want to change behaviors that have become a big part of our lives, it's important to have a plan of action.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:13.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Maybe you have heard the expression, "People don't plan to fail; they just fail to plan." And you know what? It's true—If I fail to plan for change, I'm more likely to fail.</p>  
      <p begin="00:00:24.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ANTONIO: In some ways, we may have gotten used to feeding that 'destructive wolf' without thinking about it much. But planning can help us overcome that habit and start to think about it; do I want to feed that wolf?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:37.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ANTONIO: Or, do I want to feed the protective wolf? There are five elements to a successful plan. Here they are: Number one: Set a date. Two: Make a public statement of intent. Three: Identify alternatives.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Four: Plan for obstacles. And, five: 'identify support."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:59.00" dur="00:00:21.00">ANTONIO: These are the five elements; now let's see them in action. We're going to look at an example of how Travis made a plan for success when he wanted to make a change in his life and quit smoking.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:20.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: What I would do is, I would pretty much wake up around 5 in the morning everyday and smoke half a pack of cigarettes and drink about a pot of coffee before leaving the house to go to work.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:31.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: And then I'd smoke four cigarettes on the way to work, I'd smoke constantly at work, four more cigarettes on the way home... I constantly had a cigarette in my hand.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:43.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: So by the time I finally quit at the age of 34, I had been smoking two to three packs of cigarettes everyday for years and years and years.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:01:54.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: And I figured that's roughly somewhere around, between 219,000 cigarettes and 325,000 cigarettes.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:06.00" dur="00:00:16.00">TRAVIS: I was 100% completely addicted to not just nicotine, but cigarettes themselves. Everything about it—I loved smoking, I loved cigarettes, it had become a part of who I was.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:22.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: I smoked for so long, I literally didn't know how to do anything—socially, functionally, anything-- without a cigarette in my hand. It was completely my safety blanket.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:33.00" dur="00:00:14.00">TRAVIS: Anytime, you know, I was nervous or awkward or uncomfortable, go have a cigarette. You know it kind of get's you out of the way. So I was completely dependent on cigarettes in every aspect of my life.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:47.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: It always had negative impacts, but by the time I quit it was getting really really bad. My friends and family were extremely concerned; I was the guy that smoked more than anybody.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:59.00" dur="00:00:05.00">TRAVIS: My friends couldn't stand it, couldn't stand being around.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:04.00" dur="00:00:10.00">TRAVIS: We'd be sitting at dinner and I'd have 5 cigarettes before the appetizers came. Especially, you know, this was when you could smoke in restaurants. For the non-smokers, this was disgusting.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:14.00" dur="00:00:17.00">TRAVIS: Business associates were extremely annoyed with it, because, "Where's Travis?" "Oh, he's outside smoking." I'd have to be outside having a cigarette. Socially, girlfriends hated it.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:31.00" dur="00:00:17.00">TRAVIS: I was dating this one girl, towards the very end, and I came in the house one night after going out to have a cigarette, and she was just lying in bed crying. She said, "I can't do this." She was just appalled by it. </p>
	  <p begin="00:03:48.00" dur="00:00:09.00">TRAVIS: So it was all those sort of negative effects. And I knew I was killing myself from the inside.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:03:57.00" dur="00:00:10.00">TRAVIS: All the years I smoked I was never afraid that I was going to get lung cancer and die from cigarettes—it was never a fear factor for me.</p>
	  <p begin="00:04:07.00" dur="00:00:18.00">TRAVIS: Although it clearly would have, and may still, I mean who knows, you never know. But what I was keenly aware of is that my quality of life was drastically deteriorating and steadily deteriorating every day.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:25.00" dur="00:00:17.00">TRAVIS: The dreams and things I had to do—the list of things I wanted to achieve that I had created at somepoint earlier on in life—I was looking at that list in my head realizing I wasn't going to be able to do a lot of those things.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:42.00" dur="00:00:05.00">TRAVIS: They were climbing mountains, and completing a triathlon.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:47.00" dur="00:00:20.00">TRAVIS: All these different things that I knew, at that stage, there's no way I could have physically accomplished it, or mentally accomplished it, and I knew I probably would never be able to.</p>
	  <p begin="00:05:07.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: It was, one day I was at work, and I came in from smoking a cigarette, and my fingers, on my left hand, started tingling.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:18.00" dur="00:00:13.00">TRAVIS: So, I Googled it and it came up pretty concerning, since it's my left hand, it brought up some possible heart issues. So that day, I went to the hospital.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:31.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: At that point I was concerned enough about the level of, the deterioration of my physical health, and I was scared enough to go—I never went to the doctor—but I was scared enough that afternoon.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:42.00" dur="00:00:14.00">TRAVIS: And, at some point in there I decided that—I don't know what it was, cause I had tried to quit at different points over the twenty years that I smoked,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:56.00" dur="00:00:17.00">but at that day, something in there clicked, and I decided that I was going to quit—I didn't know exactly when—but that day I decided I was going to quit.</p>
	  <p begin="00:06:13.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: I set a date soon after that for about a month away... I specifically set it on a Monday morning, that was going to be my quit day.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:06:24.00" dur="00:00:10.00">because I knew that Sunday before I was going to be at a Ravens football game and like everything else, I had become completely dependent on a pattern of,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:34.00" dur="00:00:15.00">every quarter, go outside and smoke, every half, go outside and smoke, so I knew I wouldn't be able to get through the game that without smoking, so I set it for the following Monday.</p>
	  <p begin="00:06:49.00" dur="00:00:20.00">TRAVIS: I told—when I decided to quit—I told pretty much everybody I could, everybody around me, because I knew if I didn't it would be way too easy to go right back to having a smoke if I wanted one.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:09.00" dur="00:00:15.00">TRAVIS: Because I was the guy... The heaviest smoker of the group, of everybody around, I knew that if I voiced that, people were gonna hold me to it, and I wouldn't be able to just easily back out of it.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:24.00" dur="00:00:15.00">TRAVIS: So yeah, I told everybody, and I think that was a key factor for me.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:39.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: So when I quit, I started shifting from being a smocker I knew I needed to focus on something, something different. And before long, I had focused back on that goal of completing a triathlon.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:51.00" dur="00:00:15.00">TRAVIS: So, I signed up for one, started training, and two years to the day of quitting smoking, I completed my first Olympic distance triathlon in Washington DC.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:06.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: I remember the first triathlon I ever did was s short sprint race, and that was gonna be my only one. I was just wanted to complete it.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:15.00" dur="00:00:14.00">TRAVIS: I remember about halfway through the bike I was amazed, I couldn't believe—I was amazed at the fact that I was on a bike in the middle of a triathlon... it was mind-blowing to me.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:29.00" dur="00:00:17.00">TRAVIS: And for my friends, thinking about my friends who knew me as the worst smoker they had known in their lives, when I was able to come back and tell them I had completed a triathlon, it was a pretty neat feeling.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:46.00" dur="00:00:24.00">TRAVIS: This past July, I completed my first half-Ironman distance triathlon, which is a 1.2-mile swim, a 56-mile bike, and a 13-mile run.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:10.00" dur="00:00:05.00">TRAVIS: I had to really find alternative things to get into.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:15.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: Training for triathlons really fit that nicely, because instead of sitting around for a couple hours smoking cigarettes on the porch and drinking a couple beers,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:26.00" dur="00:00:11.00">I get out on my bike with some friends, and go ride for a couple hours, or go swim for an hour, or go out running with my dog.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:37.00" dur="00:00:17.00">TRAVIS: All these things that—same periods of time—but instead of smoking, I'd do something else. Another big thing for me is that I grew up hunting, deer hunting. And when you're deer hunting, a big thing is smell.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:54.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: You try and disguise your smell. I mean if you want to be serious about you try and disguise your smell. Well as a smoker, I couldn't sit in my deer stand and not smoke. I tried to, but I couldn't.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:06.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: So I would sit there for year after year and trying to hunt seriously while smoking cigarettes. And I'd wonder why I'd never see any deer. You're putting a big... it doesn't make any sense.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:18.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: So for me know, it's a whole different thing, I'm able to take it much more seriously and enjoy it a lot more. And be that much more effective.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:29.00" dur="00:00:16.00">TRAVIS: Another thing for me is I've always been a skier, I've always loved skiing. By the end of my smoking, it was terrible, I couldn't get down the hill without taking 5 or 6 breaks.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:45.00" dur="00:00:25.00">TRAVIS: It was disgusting. Now, this past year, I ski probably harder and longer and more aggressively than I have in 15 years. So that's like a whole different benefit I never really even thought about.</p>
	  <p begin="00:11:10.00" dur="00:00:15.00">TRAVIS: So when I decided to quit, I knew it was gonna be a battle at every turn, in terms of avoiding temptations and opportunities to smoke, so I saw obstacles everywhere,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:11:25.00" dur="00:00:11.00">and tried to do whatever I could to anticipate those obstacles and plan for them. So, whether it was having gum or sunflower seeds, or going to the gym...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:11:36.00" dur="00:00:15.00">TRAVIS: A big thing for me was, I didn't want any down time, I didn't want any dead time, I needed to always be doing something in that first month or 2, I didn't want any time just sitting around.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:11:51.00" dur="00:00:03.00">TRAVIS: Cause when I'd get bored, that's a time when I would smoke.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:11:54.00" dur="00:00:16.00">TRAVIS: So a big thing for me was staying busy, having a plan, planning out my day, keeping it full, and trying to replace any of those down times with anything I could that was something healthy, or something positive,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:12:10.00" dur="00:00:18.00">whether it be going to the gym, cooking a healthy meal, or anything that would keep me from having time to think about craving a cigarette.</p>
	  <p begin="00:12:28.00" dur="00:00:10.00">TRAVIS: So the hardest thing about quitting, the toughest part about quitting for me, I think, was just re-learning how to do everything without cigarettes.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:12:38.00" dur="00:00:06.00">TRAVIS: You know, learning how to hang out in social situations without having a cigarette in my hand.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:12:44.00" dur="00:00:13.00">TRAVIS: Driving without smoking, eating dinner and not having a cigarette immediately after, getting stressed out and not going to have a cigarette, celebrating something without having a cigarette.</p>
	  <p begin="00:12:57.00" dur="00:00:23.00">TRAVIS: Every little moment was a trigger point, so it was basically slowly relearning all those little micro moments that make up a day, and learning to do them again without a cigarette.</p>
	  <p begin="00:13:21.00" dur="00:00:10.00">TRAVIS: It's funny, those times when I needed people to lean on, and needed help and support from people to be encouraged me to stay strong and not to give in to having a cigarette,</p>  
	  <p begin="00:13:31.00" dur="00:00:03.00">I was amazed at the different people that came out of the woodwork.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:13:34.00" dur="00:00:08.00">TRAVIS: I had a friend who I never would have excepted to be a source of support.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:13:42.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: He came out and one day he's like, within a couple of weeks, he's like, "Man, you look 10 years younger right off the bat, keep it up, keep it going," and it was people like that, the positive support,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:13:54.00" dur="00:00:10.00">because just saying that "no I'm not gonna smoke", wasn't enough for me, the negatives weren't enough. That didn't make...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:14:04.00" dur="00:00:08.00">TRAVIS: Understanding the negatives of the addiction wasn't enough for me to stop. I had to focus on the positives of getting over that.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:14:12.00" dur="00:00:08.00">TRAVIS: So, that's what I tried to do was focus on feeling better, being able to breathe better, smell things better, taste things better,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:14:20.00" dur="00:00:17.00">eventually being able to actually run a mile, and then 2 and 3 and 4, and do things that, feeling myself get healthier.</p>
	  <p begin="00:14:37.00" dur="00:00:15.00">TRAVIS: So yeah I'd tried to quite many times throughout the years, I think the biggest difference for me that all those times that I tried to quit, I had never 100% committed to wanting to be a non-smoker.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:14:52.00" dur="00:00:25.00">TRAVIS: I think the key for me in quitting was really wanting it, really 100% wanting it and being committed to quitting, and wanting to be healthier, wanting to have a different lifestyle than the one I had,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:15:17.00" dur="00:00:13.00">and wanting that more than wanting a cigarette.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:15:30.00" dur="00:00:15.00">TRAVIS: I guess I was disgusted with myself with how addicted I'd become and how powerless I was over it. And I was disgusted with myself physically, too, and listening to my lungs crackle.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:15:45.00" dur="00:00:13.00">TRAVIS: My mother, a couple years affter I'd quit, she admitted that she was sort of in the back of her mind, she was planning on me dying before she did.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:15:58.00" dur="00:00:08.00">TRAVIS: She'd been thinking, alright, how are we gonna deal with this funeral, when this guy smokes so much...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:16:06.00" dur="00:00:17.00">TRAVIS: I never realized the impact I was having also on the people around me, and how much it hurt them. I had friends that were seriously concerned. It took a toll on my friends and family.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:16:23.00" dur="00:00:18.00">TRAVIS: Not only did I not realize it, I was so hooked on the drug and the addiction that I probably wouldn't have cared anyways. It was that much more powerful. Cigarettes were more powerful than anything.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:16:41.00" dur="00:00:20.00">TRAVIS: I would stand out in the freezing snow and rain and smoke, I would go without eating or drinking to smoke, if I had to. Cigarettes came before everything. Before relationships, before food, and basic survival.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:17:01.00" dur="00:00:11.00">TRAVIS: Cigarettes were more powerful than all that. It's been interesting now, looking back, cause it's been 3 years since I quit smoking at this point.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:17:12.00" dur="00:00:10.00">TRAVIS: The first year of quitting was probably, I'm not gonna lie, an extremely difficult and challenging year.</p>
	  <p begin="00:17:22.00" dur="00:00:13.00">TRAVIS: My experience was, the first couple of months of quitting, I became very sick. I don't know if it's just your body balancing out and processing the things, but I was very confused.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:17:35.00" dur="00:00:14.00">TRAVIS: I never got sick as a smoker, but I quit and was sick as a dog for a couple months. And I didn't really feel like I started to balance out for another 12 months. I was all over the place.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:17:49.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: But looking back now, it's such a totally different life, it feels like a different lifetime.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:18:01.00" dur="00:00:13.00">TRAVIS: I can't imagine... I never could imagine being a non-smoker, and looking back now I can't even imagine being a smoker, and doing that physical damage to my body.</p>
	  <p begin="00:18:14.00" dur="00:00:17.00">TRAVIS: It's amazing to me, the things that are possible; I couldn't have even imagined at the time. You know, people say, anything is possible—it's truly a reality!</p> 
	  <p begin="00:18:31.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: I think if, whatever it is, smoking or drinking or drugs or whatever, that's limiting someone, when you're so far into that addiction,</p>  
	  <p begin="00:18:43.00" dur="00:00:11.00">you can't see past it to see the enormous opportunities and potential that's right there just beyond that.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:18:54.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: Once you clear a little bit of that away, you start to realize that it's endless, in terms of what you can do physically and mentally.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:19:06.00" dur="00:00:09.00">TRAVIS: Quitting smoking for me is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but it's also the most rewarding thing I've ever done.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:19:15.00" dur="00:00:12.00">TRAVIS: Making a lifestyle change of that magnitude only scratches the surface of the possibilities of what can come down the road.</p>
	  <p begin="00:19:27.00" dur="00:00:16.00">ANTONIO: As you can see, planning involves a lot of elements. Here's an interesting fact, research indicates that the first 90 days is a particularly risky time for relapsing to an old behavior.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:19:43.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: So, the next three months are critical to any kind of behavior change. It's true, change can be difficult, but if we plan for it, we're more likely to succeed.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:19:54.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: You're the expert on what works for you, so think about changes or accomplishments you've successfully made in the past. Think through the elements that contributed to that success.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:20:06.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: It could be a success or change related to school, family, or other anything else in your life.</p>
