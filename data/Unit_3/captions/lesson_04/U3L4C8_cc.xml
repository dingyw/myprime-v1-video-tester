		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Sometimes it's hard to let people know we need their help. It's not an easy thing to do, so it's natural to be a little bit reluctant about asking others for support.</p>
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: Well, for me growing up as a man, the son of someone in the military, being in the military, being a big guy. It's very macho.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: It's not fashionable to ask for help or to make yourself vulnerable, or to admit that you have a problem.</p>
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: It's a feeling of fear, fear of judgment, fear of letting people down. And you can rationalize out of those feelings any way you want, you know, go get drunk and beat somebody up, or go do whatever.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: But I—I wanna speak for myself, not anybody else—when I would be alone, I would know that these actions, these behaviors, this lifestyle was wrong.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: And it was fear—fear or all those things, shame, judgment, all the other things that kept me from reaching out.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: And of course when I ultimately did start reaching out, people lined up to help. And there's a part of you that's like, "I'm such an idiot for not doing this sooner."</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: You don't have to die slowly—and that's what I was doing, I wouldn't be here now if I didn't ask for that help. You're gonna get it right eventually, you might as well just do it sooner.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: Either you're gonna get it right eventually or you're gonna die, so you might as well do it sooner.</p>
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: I didn't ask for that helop because I was afraid of the judgment, I was afraid my family would come down on me, my parents would disown me...</p> 
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: But those people answered the call... People will line up to help you, my family lined up to help me. I told all 5 of my siblings at once. I wasn't the tough guy I am not, I was a bawling, embarrassed...</p> 
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: I was mortified, everyone in the room was crying. And it went from 10 minutes of that to "What can we do?" And we decided as a group what we were gonna do.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: And from there, we decided that I was gonna go to a treatment facility, and the next day, God bless all of them, we all went over as a family to tell my parents.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: I was terrified—my dad, stringent, strict—here I was, his youngest son, in the most vulnerable position possible. In my mind I was saying I had failed, I had let them down. But they were right there.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: Sure, they were shocked, they were not even surprised, they had a son that had kinda disappeared on them for the past year, but they just wanted to help. Yes, it's a problem, but what can we do to move on?</p> 
	    <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: My work... my work was great. They were like, go, do what you need to do. If you wanna work when you come back, fine, if you don't, we understand.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: If you want to, you have a job waiting for you. It restored my faith in humanity.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: It's almost cheesy... But people were just ready to help. Think of it this way--if someone asked me for help, I mean, sure! Who would turn someone like that away?</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PETE: When I was mired in it I didn't see that people would be willing to help, but the benefit of some distance from that lifestyle, it seems so crazy that I was in a place where I'd think no one would help me.</p>
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROBERT: You need some outside support, somebody at least to say, or at least to raise the thought, that hey, you might have a problem. Some people might have a problem doing that, and they need somebody else to say it.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROBERT: With the complexity of the brain, it almost fights against you, the body, everything you're going through, you've got all this positive reinforcement, and now you're trying to say you don't have a problem, it's just fun.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROBERT: You are shooting yourself in the foot. Have the gall to stand up against yourself and maybe question yourself once in a while.</p>
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: Experiences in combat can trigger behaviors, high-risk behaviors when you're not incombat anymore. The military has loads of places where you can go and get help.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ROB: There's a stigma attached to being the guy with an alcohol problem, especially in your Unit, you just gotta power through that stigma--alcoholism is a disease, and you gotta get better.</p>
        <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: I think the change for me came about when I came out of myself. My drug use made me a very introverted person. I could be alone with my drugs and be totally safe.</p> 
        <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: When I began to branch out and go to AA groups, social programs, churches, I began to build a small network of people who kinda knew what I was going through and they would no longer let me isolate, </p>
		<p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">so all I had to do was pick up the phone, no matter how bad it got or how tough it got, a family member, or someone in the AA family, or someone in the church... And for me that was the strongest support.</p>
        <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">GEORGE: And my family was supportive all the way through the end, and I don't think I could have made it without them.</p>
