		<p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:09.75">ANTONIO: Sometimes it's hard to let people know we need their help. It's not an easy thing to do, so it's natural to be a little bit reluctant about asking others for support.</p>
		<p begin="00:00:10.00" dur="00:00:13.00">PETE: Well, for me growing up as a man, the son of somebody in the military, being in the military, being a big guy. It's all, it's very macho.</p> 
		<p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:07.00">PETE: It's not fashionable to ask for help or to make yourself vulnerable, or to admit that you have a problem.</p>
		<p begin="00:00:30.00" dur="00:00:16.00">PETE: It's a feeling of fear, fear of judgment, fear of letting people down. You know you're embarrased and you can rationalize and identify out of those feelings any way that you want, </p> 
		<p begin="00:00:46.00" dur="00:00:17.00">you know, go get drunk and beat somebody up, or go do whatever. But I—I wanna speak for myself, not anybody else—when I would be alone, I would know that these actions, these behaviors, this lifestyle was wrong.</p> 
		<p begin="00:01:03.00" dur="00:00:07.00">PETE: And it was fear—fear or all those things, shame, judgment, all the other things that kept me from reaching out.</p> 
		<p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:11.00">PETE: And of course when I ultimately did reach out, people lined up to help. And there's a part of you that's like, "I'm such an idiot for not doing this sooner."</p> 
		<p begin="00:01:21.00" dur="00:00:16.00">PETE: You don't have to die slowly—and that's what I was doing, I wouldn't be here now if I didn't ask for that help. You're gonna get it right eventually, you might as well just do it sooner.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:01:37.00" dur="00:00:05.00">PETE: Either you're gonna get it right eventually or you're gonna die, so you might as well do it sooner.</p>
	    <p begin="00:01:42.00" dur="00:00:07.00">PETE: I didn't ask for that help because I was afraid of the judgment, I was afraid my family would come down on me, my parents would disown me... </p> 
	    <p begin="00:01:49.00" dur="00:00:21.00">PETE: But those people answered the call... People will line up to help you, my family lined up to help me. I told all 5 of my siblings at once. I wasn't the tough guy I am now, I was a bawling, embarrassed...</p> 
	    <p begin="00:02:10.00" dur="00:00:13.00">PETE: I was mortified, I was helpless, everyone in the room was crying. And it went from 10 minutes of that to "What can we do?" And we decided as a group what we were gonna do.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:02:23.00" dur="00:00:17.00">PETE: And then from there, we decided that I was gonna go to a treatment facility, and the next day, God bless all of them, we all went over as a family to tell my parents.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:02:40.00" dur="00:00:18.00">PETE: I was terrified—my dad, career military officer, very stringent, very strict—here I was, his youngest son, in the most vulnerable position possible. In my mind I was saying I had failed, I had let them down. But he was right there.</p> 
	    <p begin="00:02:58.00" dur="00:00:13.00">PETE: And my mom was right there. Sure, they were shocked, they were not even surprised, they had a son that had kinda disappeared on them for the previous year-- they knew something was wrong, but they were just ready to help.</p> 
		<p begin="00:03:11.00" dur="00:00:03.00">PETE: Yes, it's a problem, but what can we do to move on?</p> 
	    <p begin="00:03:14.00" dur="00:00:11.00">PETE: My work... my work was great. My work was like, go, do what you need to do. If you wanna work when you come back, fine, if you don't, we understand.</p> 
		<p begin="00:03:25.00" dur="00:00:05.00">PETE: If you want to, you have a job waiting for you. It restored my faith in humanity.</p> 
		<p begin="00:03:30.00" dur="00:00:12.00">PETE: It's almost cheesy... But people were just ready to help. I think of it this way--if someone asked me for help, I mean, sure! Who would turn someone like that away?</p> 
		<p begin="00:03:42.00" dur="00:00:15.00">PETE: When I was mired in it I didn't see that people would be willing to help, but the benefit of some distance from that lifestyle, it seems so crazy that I was in a place where I'd think no one would help me.</p>
		<p begin="00:03:57.00" dur="00:00:19.00">ROB: Experiences in combat can trigger behaviors, high-risk behaviors when you're not incombat anymore. The military has loads of places where you can go and get help.</p> 
		<p begin="00:04:16.00" dur="00:00:15.00">ROB: And I think, there's a stigma attached to being the guy with an alcohol problem, especially in your Unit, you just gotta power through that stigma--alcoholism is a disease, and you gotta get better.</p>
        <p begin="00:04:31.00" dur="00:00:15.00">GEORGE: I think the change for me came about when I came out of myself. My drug use made me a very introverted person. I could be alone by myself with my drugs and be totally safe.</p> 
        <p begin="00:04:46.00" dur="00:00:14.00">GEORGE: When I began to branch out and go to NA groups, social programs, churches, I began to build a small network of people who kinda knew what I was going through and they would no longer let me isolate, </p>
		<p begin="00:05:00.00" dur="00:00:10.00">so all I had to do was pick up the phone, no matter how bad it got or how tough it got, a family member, or someone in the NA family, or someone in the church... And for me that was the strongest support.</p>
        <p begin="00:05:10.00" dur="00:00:07.00">GEORGE: But my family was supportive all the way through the end, and I don't think I could have made it without them.</p>
		<p begin="00:05:17.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ROBERT: I got a coworker and I have tried to talk to him nicely but it's not always that easy and he's got the same...</p>  
		<p begin="00:05:28.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ROBERT: I understand now the defenses, the sheild, you know he's sitting their with an ironclad like trojan sheild, I'm not going to be able to fight through that, you almost need...</p> 
		<p begin="00:05:38.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ROBERT: You need some outside support, somebody at least to say, or maybe just to raise the thought, it might be that easy for someboady to be like hey, you might have a problem.</p> 
		<p begin="00:05:46.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ROBERT: You might want to look into that. Somebody might have no problem doing that, and they help themselves but...</p> 
		<p begin="00:05:51.00" dur="00:00:18.00">ROBERT: With the complexity of the brain, it almost fights against you, the body, everything you're going through, you've got all this positive reinforcement, and now you're trying to say no I don't have a problem, it's just for fun.</p> 
		<p begin="00:06:09.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ROBERT: You are shooting yourself in the foot. Have the gall to stand up against yourself and maybe question yourself once in a while at least.</p>
