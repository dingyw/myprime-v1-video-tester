      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:14.75">ANTONIO: Change can be difficult. If we're in the Orange or Red Phase, we usually need additional support to make the changes we want. This is especially true for the Red Phase. But remember, help is available.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: We've seen how we might be tricked about the seriousness of drinking or drug use in the Orange and Red Phase.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:22.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: People in these Phases face some difficult decisions about high-risk choices. And they also face challenges in carrying out these decisions, but we are not alone.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Professional counseling and support groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous have supported millions of people in making difficult changes.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:42.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: Most of us have identified social support for making low-risk drinking and drug choices. But to benefit from that support, I have to do my part to stay connected to it.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:54.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: If you're curious about working with a support group, here's a video you might want to watch. You can also find more information about support tools and networks in the Resources section.</p>
