      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:14.75">ANTONIO: Social influences are all around us, Friends, family, and co-workers all influence the choices we make. So do social norms, advertising, and even the availability and pricing of drugs or alcohol.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: And, if there's social dependence in our group of friends, it may seem like just about everybody makes high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: But there's also social support for low-risk choices. We just need to know where to look for it. To learn more about social support within the Army, I sat down with Sergeant Ross Scott.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Soldiers can face very different challenges than civilians, and these challenges can be difficult to overcome. Can you tell me more about that, Sergeant?</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:44.00" dur="00:00:08.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: Antonio, it's true. The Army recognizes this is a unique situation, and has provided structures for it. This program is just one of those.</p>
	  <p begin="00:00:52.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Okay. So we'll talk more about those support structures in a bit, but first can you tell me about some of the challenges soldiers might face?</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:00.00" dur="00:00:06.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: Yeah. With pre-deployment, it's the "hurry up and wait." Everything's going very fast or very slow.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:06.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And there are other challenges that come with pre-deployment?</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:09.00" dur="00:00:08.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: Yes, there is. You always have to worry about leaving family and friends behind, who's gonna take care of the household matter, who's gonna take care of the bills.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:17.00" dur="00:00:03.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: As well as, each deployment is different from one another.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:20.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: So, pre-deployment is a time of uncertainty...</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:23.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: Yes it is. It's that one last time to get out and do things, it's either binge drink, party, or spend time with friends and family.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:32.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: What about when Soldiers come back?</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:34.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: You have to reestablish yourself when you come back, so that's a challenge in itself. Just getting to know friends and family again, getting back in the groove of things.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:01:43.00" dur="00:00:10.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: As well as... you no longer have that adrenaline rush when you were down range, hot having your weapon with you at all times, or just driving in regular traffic. That's a challenge in itself.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:53.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: So there are these difficulties, but there is also support they can turn to.</p>
	  <p begin="00:01:58.00" dur="00:00:12.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: Yes, friends and family, as well as your battle buddy, can all support low-risk choices. As well, Soldiers can always turn to their chain of command, the chaplain, or organizations like ASAP.</p>
	  <p begin="00:02:10.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: Okay, thanks Sergeant. We're going to talk more with Sergeant Scott about these resources, but first let's hear from some Soldiers.</p>
	  <p begin="00:02:20.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: We're going to start with the most difficult question for the three of you. Your name, where you're from, and just tell me a little bit about yourself.</p>
	  <p begin="00:02:26.00" dur="00:00:08.00">SERGEANT CARTER: My name is Stephanie Carter, I'm from Georgia originally, I've been in the military for 16 years, I'm a single mom of two boys, 14 and 9.</p>
	  <p begin="00:02:34.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: Tell me a little bit about your experience in the military.</p>
	  <p begin="00:02:37.00" dur="00:00:10.00">SERGEANT CARTER: I've been to several duty stations, several countries, to include Germany, Belgium, Italy, Luxembourg, France.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:02:47.00" dur="00:00:14.00">SERGEANT CARTER: I'm a 25-Bravo, which is computers in the military, I have worked with COMSEC, which goes under government secrets-type things.</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:01.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: And you, your name, a little bit about yourself.</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:03.00" dur="00:00:08.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: I'm Sergeant Salinas, I'm from Floresville, Texas, 68-Tango, Veterinary Technician. Been in a little over 10 years.</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:11.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And how has your experience been these 10 years so far?</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:14.00" dur="00:00:02.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: It's been good, I like it, I like the Army.</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:16.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: Where've your travels taken you?</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:18.00" dur="00:00:05.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: Hawaii, North Carolina, Mississippi, and Missouri.</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:23.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: Your name, sir?</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:25.00" dur="00:00:06.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: I'm Sergeant Simpson, I'm from Los Angeles, California. And I've been in the Army for 8 years.</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:31.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: Okay, and how's your experience been?</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:33.00" dur="00:00:06.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: It's been pretty good, I've travelled to quite a few countries and states that I never would have been able if I hadn't joined the military.</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:39.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: Thanks so much for joining us.</p>  
	  <p begin="00:03:41.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: One of the things that we've talked about in this program is that Soldiers can face unique, day-to-day challenges, so the first question I want to ask is, what are some of the pressures that you face on a daily basis?</p>
	  <p begin="00:03:53.00" dur="00:00:13.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: At the end of the day--you have an end of the day—Soldiers don't. You go home when the job is done. You don't get to go home at the end of the day.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:05.00" dur="00:00:14.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: You go home when the job is done. If a task comes down at 5 o'clock, and we got equipment accountability, we're gonna be there until that's done.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:19.00" dur="00:00:06.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: You can go home at 10, 11, it just depends on how long it takes. Where a civilian can go home at the end of the day.</p>
	  <p begin="00:04:25.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: And when you have a schedule like that, where you can't go home when you want to, what does that mean when you start to make decisions when you're stressed out and you're worn out.</p>
	  <p begin="00:04:36.00" dur="00:00:07.00">SERGEANT CARTER: Well, it can overflow into your family life. I've been a single parent the whole time in the military.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:43.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT CARTER: If my day is stressful, then no matter how much you try to put it off, when you get home it then overflows to my children.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:52.00" dur="00:00:07.00">SERGEANT CARTER: I might be agitated more quickly at things that they do on a normal day, it wouldn't bother me at all.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:04:59.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT CARTER: So now it's affecting my home life, because of something at work. Civilians, if they don't like their job, you can transfer, you can quit.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:10.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT CARTER: But if I get stationed here, I'm gonna be here for 3 years, and if I come in not liking the people, then we're gonna be sitting face-to-face for a whole 3 years, and there's nothing I can do about it.</p>
	  <p begin="00:05:21.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: What are some other pressures that a Soldier might face when he or she knows that they're is going to be deployed?</p>
	  <p begin="00:05:27.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: I think it's the unknown. Especially like for first-timers. You don't really know what to expect, what to prepare for.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:05:36.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: As you go through a couple of them, it's a little bit more easier, but I think the first deployment is probably toughest for everybody.</p>
	  <p begin="00:05:45.00" dur="00:00:02.00">ANTONIO: What are some of the things that they're thinking about?</p>
	  <p begin="00:05:47.00" dur="00:00:18.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: Their family, if they're married, if they're not. Their stuff, situating bills, car payments, insurance payments, stuff like that.</p>
	  <p begin="00:06:05.00" dur="00:00:13.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: From my personal experience, I got deployed in '03, and we were one of the first units to go to Iraq, so the pressure for was probably the fact that we were going in, not knowing what to expect,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:18.00" dur="00:00:09.00">because no one was in Iraq yet to tell us what to get prepared for, so we were going off of assumptions and stuff like that.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:27.00" dur="00:00:06.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: It's kind of interesting—when we were in the airplane flying over there, they were showing us war movies, watching Saving Private Ryan,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:33.00" dur="00:00:07.00">and we already had it in our head that it was gonna be like that situation—as soon as we get off the plane we're gonna be fighting, as soon as we get off the plane...</p> 
	  <p begin="00:06:40.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: Which isn't the situation when we got there, but that's what you've got going in the back of your head, while you're on your way over to this country—not knowing what to expect.</p>
	  <p begin="00:06:49.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: When you return from being deployed, are there some things that are not natural? Say, not having your weapon on you?</p>
	  <p begin="00:06:56.00" dur="00:00:07.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: Yes, absolutely. When you have it for a year with you, everywhere you go, at all times, it feels like another part of your body.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:03.00" dur="00:00:05.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: So when you get back and you don't have it, you kind of have this feeling like you are forgetting something.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:08.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: I remember, quite often, when I was coming back from, when I came back from Iraq and I was living in Colorado, When I was leaving the building, I would have this feeling of checking... "Where's my weapon?"</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:17.00" dur="00:00:04.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: "I should have me weapon." Then you'de realize okay I'm back in the states and I don't need it anymore.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:07:21.00" dur="00:00:03.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: It takes a few months for me to get used to that.</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:24.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: If you were having a problem with drugs or alcohol, where would you go?</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:30.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: I'd probably go to an NCO—somebody I can trust. That would probably be the first person I'd go to. Ask them for some advice.</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:39.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: And why would you go to an NCO first?</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:42.00" dur="00:00:08.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: Because they're your senior, they've been in longer; they know the Army programs that are out there to help out, help out new Soldiers.</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:50.00" dur="00:00:07.00">ANTONIO: Are there any other places you would go?</p>
	  <p begin="00:07:53.00" dur="00:00:09.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: Army One Source, they're there for help, and the ASAP program.</p>
	  <p begin="00:08:02.00" dur="00:00:05.00">ANTONIO: What would you do if a buddy told you they wanted to quit drinking?</p>
	  <p begin="00:08:07.00" dur="00:00:10.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: If a buddy came up to me and asked me if he wanted to quit drinking, I'd ask him how much is he drinking, what's going on, what happened.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:17.00" dur="00:00:16.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: And then I'd probably recommend him to go to an AA meeting and see if he really needs help, and I'd probably go and see if he wants to talk to an NCO with him, and I'd be there to support him.</p>
	  <p begin="00:08:33.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: Any other places you may send him?</p>
	  <p begin="00:08:39.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: You could probably send him to the chaplain, he could talk to maybe a spiritual advisor, maybe his pastor outside of the military—or whoever he feels comfortable talking to.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:08:50.00" dur="00:00:03.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: If he needed support, to be there with him.</p>
	  <p begin="00:08:53.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So say a fellow Soldier comes up to, and they tell you that they want to quit drinking, what do you do?</p>
	  <p begin="00:09:00.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: First I would talk to them, and let them know that I support him or her in the situation, and try to find the best way to get them help.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:11.00" dur="00:00:12.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: Because drinking is quite a bit of a serious situation in the military, and I think that we should show our soldiers and our peers that we care enough to get them help,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:23.00" dur="00:00:06.00">so they don't think that they're alone in the situation—or that they'll be judged.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:09:29.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT SIMPSON: So I would try to the best of my ability to help them... But I'm not a counselor, I'm not trained in that, so I would talk to them as much as I could but also recommend them to talk to somebody, a professional.</p>
	  <p begin="00:09:40.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: I think that's a really good thing to do, just to support each other and try to be there for each other. Get somebody some help.</p>
	  <p begin="00:09:51.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: So you got your buddy's back?</p>
	  <p begin="00:09:52.00" dur="00:00:01.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: Yeah.</p>
	  <p begin="00:09:53.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Why?</p>
	  <p begin="00:09:54.00" dur="00:00:08.00">SERGEANT SALINAS: Because if you can't trust the people you work with, who can you trust? They're the ones we have to fight next to.</p>
	  <p begin="00:10:02.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: So what would you do if a buddy came up to you and said that, "I have a problem, I want to quit drinking?"</p>
	  <p begin="00:10:12.00" dur="00:00:12.00">SERGEANT CARTER: I would pull the Soldier to the side, and talk to them privately. When you approach a Soldier in a public forum, then it causes them to draw in,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:24.00" dur="00:00:14.00">and they're not really receptive of the help that you try to offer them, but if the Solider has a problem, then I would reiterate the things that are on the line if they don't get help, such as their career,</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:39.00" dur="00:00:08.00">their families, the means for taking care of themselves, which is their paycheck—if you don't have a job, you don't have a paycheck.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:47.00" dur="00:00:10.00">SERGEANT CARTER: And just their overall health itself, how it's affected by alcohol. And hopefully this will motivate them to want to go and get help.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:10:57.00" dur="00:00:13.00">SERGEANT CARTER: But if the Soldier is not motivated, by the help then we have what you call "command referral," and that is to make the Soldier go get help if they don't want to go get help on their own.</p>
	  <p begin="00:11:10.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: So, Sergeant, if a Soldier is looking for help with a alcohol or drug problem, where is the best place to start?</p>
	  <p begin="00:11:18.00" dur="00:00:07.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: You should start with your chain of command. But if you don't feel comfortable, or feel supported, you can always go to other resources that are available.</p>
	  <p begin="00:11:25.00" dur="00:00:03.00">ANTONIO: Other resources within the Army?</p>
	  <p begin="00:11:28.00" dur="00:00:06.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: Yes, there is always your Chaplain, as well as, you can always go to your ASAP. Every garrison is supported by an ASAP program.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:11:34.00" dur="00:00:05.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: You can always go to those people for any issues that you may have with substance abuse.</p>
	  <p begin="00:11:39.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ANTONIO: And a Soldier can go to any one of these places for support?</p>
	  <p begin="00:11:43.00" dur="00:00:08.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: That is correct. Also there is the UPL. The UPL can also point you in the right direction if you're having any substance abuse matters.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:11:51.00" dur="00:00:11.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: As well as, there is the Soldier Family Assistance Center, which can help with many issues, as well as they can help with substance abuse matters there as well.</p>
	  <p begin="00:12:02.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: So, if a Soldier is having a problem, they should know that the Army understands the pressures they face, and that there are programs designed to help them.</p> 
      <p begin="00:12:11.00" dur="00:00:01.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: Absolutely.</p> 	  
	  <p begin="00:12:12.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Thanks so much for joining us, Sergeant.</p>
	  <p begin="00:12:13.00" dur="00:00:02.00">SERGEANT ROSS SCOTT: You're welcome, Antonio.</p>
	  <p begin="00:12:15.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: When we're making a change, it helps to have support from people who are important to us. And most of us have more support than we think.</p>
	  <p begin="00:12:23.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Some of us might find support in family or friends. For others, it might be co-workers, teammates on a sports team, or people at church.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:12:32.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Here's a set of questions about potential support for the choices you want to make. Read each question and answer them as best as you can.</p>
