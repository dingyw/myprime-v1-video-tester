      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">ANTONIO: You know the old saying, "If at first you don't succeed...Try, try again."  Well, it may seem a little corny, but if there weren't some truth to it, it wouldn't still be around.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: When it comes to making low-risk drugs and alcohol choices, some people decide to change and never go back. But some days might still be a struggle.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: And if you do not succeed in making low-risk choices on any one day, I encourage you think of the challenges that you encountered, and then simply "Try, try, again."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:01.00">ANTONIO: Thank you for the time and thought you've put into this course. I hope you find it rewarding.</p>
