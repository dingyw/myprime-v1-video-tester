      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">ANTONIO: You know the old saying, "If at first you don't succeed...Try, try again."  Well, it may seem a little corny, but if there weren't some truth to it, it wouldn't still be around.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:10.00">ANTONIO: When it comes to making low-risk drugs and alcohol choices, some people decide to change and never go back. But some days might still be a struggle.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:21.00" dur="00:00:12.00">ANTONIO: And if you do not succeed in making low-risk choices on any one day, I encourage you think of the challenges that you encountered, and then simply "Try, try, again."</p>
      <p begin="00:00:33.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ANTONIO: Thank you for the time and thought you've put into this course. I hope you find it rewarding.</p>

      <p begin="00:00:49.00" dur="00:00:02.00">PEOPLE ON THE STREET: I made missteps along the way.</p>		
      <p begin="00:00:51.00" dur="00:00:02.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: But I have discovered the secret.</p>	
      <p begin="00:00:53.00" dur="00:00:02.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: That after climbing a great hill.</p>		
      <p begin="00:00:55.00" dur="00:00:03.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: One only finds that there are many hills to climb.</p>

      <p begin="00:01:01.00" dur="00:00:04.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: To steal a view of the glorious vista that surrounds me.</p>		
      <p begin="00:01:05.00" dur="00:00:03.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: To look back on the distance I have come.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:08.00" dur="00:00:02.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: But I can rest only for a moment.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:10.00" dur="00:00:03.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: For with freedom comes responcibilties.</p>	
      <p begin="00:01:13.00" dur="00:00:01.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: And I dare not linger.</p>
      <p begin="00:01:14.00" dur="00:00:10.00">PERSON ON THE STREET: For my long walk has yet not ended.</p>
