	   You know the old saying, “If at first you don’t succeed…Try, try again.”  Well, it may seem a little corny, but if there weren’t some truth to it, it wouldn’t still be around.
When it comes to making low-risk drugs and alcohol choices, some people decide to change and never look back.  But some days might still be a struggle.  And if you do not succeed in making low-risk choices on any one day, I encourage you think of the challenges that you encountered, and then simply “Try, try, again.”
Thank you for the time and thought you’ve put into this course.  I hope you find it rewarding.
