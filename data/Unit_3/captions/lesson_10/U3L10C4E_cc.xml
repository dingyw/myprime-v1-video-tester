      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Your answers suggest you're struggling a bit to make this process fit for you. Perhaps you're feeling like this is just a hoop you need to jump through.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Or maybe you feel like some things need to change, but you're not sure this is the way you want to do it. It could be that some other big things have just happened in your life and your attention is elsewhere.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: These are not uncommon things, particularly for folks trying to decide is change something I want. The question is, where do I go from here?</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: There are several ways you could decide. You could decide to do nothing and proceed on your present course.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: We've outlined some of the risks that might occur with that choice and you know the benefits far better than we can. You could decide that you need some more time.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: If you decide that route, we encourage you to make that an active process where you think through the pros and cons of the status quoâ€”the way things are now.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: You might return to Lesson 7 in the Reflecting Unit [insert link] to help you with this process. Finally, you might decide, despite some reservations, that you do need to bump up the importance of your values.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: A return to the Values activity [insert link] might help you in doing this. You might also seek out a trusted friend who would give you a straight opinion about how they see your choices affecting you.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Of course, we do have an opinion on this matter. We hope you'll choose the things that matter most and make decisions that support those things. But, while we may have an opinion, it's your call to make.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">RAY: Whatever you decide, remember that you've made a plan for your future that puts some steps in place for you. Now it's time to consider if you are ready to set a date to begin.</p>
