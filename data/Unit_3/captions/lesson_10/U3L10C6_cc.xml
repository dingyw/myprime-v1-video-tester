      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:14.75">ROB: I think if your aren't sure you want to make a change... That's a real black and white distinction, at least it was for me, there was no grey area.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:15.00" dur="00:00:13.00">ROB: I was positive I wanted to make a change because I was sick of the way I felt. But I think it's different for everybody.</p>      
      <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:04.00">ROB: There are some people who say, "Oh , no you gotta hit rock bottom before you can go back."</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:32.00" dur="00:00:18.00">ROB: And I think rock bottom is different for everbody and if you are sitting there contemplating making a change, if it's that much of an issue in your life that you have to think about it maybe it's time to make a change.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:50.00" dur="00:00:08.00">ROB: What's the worst that can happen? You don;t get drunk for a couple of weeks and see what happens.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:58.00" dur="00:00:13.00">RACHEL: Nothing is so bad that a drink or a drug won't make worse and nothing is so good that a drink or a drug won't take away and I have learned that through exsperiance.</p>	  
	  <p begin="00:01:11.00" dur="00:00:06.00">ANTONIO: At this point, we've looked at a lot of different tools for protecting what we value.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:17.00" dur="00:00:11.00">ANTONIO: Some people may want to avoid problems, but don't feel ready to commit to their choice. Others may want to avoid problems, but still have a desire to make high-risk choices.</p> 
      <p begin="00:01:28.00" dur="00:00:09.00">ANTONIO: Whatever your decision, you now know a lot about what it takes to succeed and why â€“ so you are ready when the time is right.</p>
