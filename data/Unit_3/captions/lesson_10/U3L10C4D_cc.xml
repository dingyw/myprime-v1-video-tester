	   Your answers suggest you might be at least somewhat unsure about both your values and your plans. This isn't an uncommon experience for people as they consider the possibility of making changes in their life. On the one hand, we can be comfortable with the way things are, or we like the way they are. On the other we feel like something may need to change. This can be a tough spot, and sometimes we can get stuck. If I might offer some advice, other folks like you often find that focusing on the values side of the equation can help them become unstuck. Once they have the values thing sorted out, then the other part can begin to move too. Of course, you'd have to decide if that is the way to go.
If you opt for focusing on values, you might ask yourself if there are conflicts between what is most important to you. Two values may be balancing each other out. Perhaps returning to the values activity [insert link] might clarify things and help you in deciding which way to move. 
Other people find that talking things through with someone they trust can help. Some folks are thinkers and they just need to sit down and really consider what these values mean to them, and how they fit into their life. You're in the best position to decide what approach may work best for you. 
On the other hand, if you decide the plan should be your focus, you might try to pinpoint what is keeping your score more moderate. Perhaps the plan isn't quite ready. Or maybe your confidence for making it happen is running a little low. It could also be that you have the right plan, but it's not quite the right time for it. Figuring out if it's one of these three things – plan, confidence, timing – or something else that needs to change, might assist you in moving ahead. First, you should consider if you are ready to set a date to begin.
