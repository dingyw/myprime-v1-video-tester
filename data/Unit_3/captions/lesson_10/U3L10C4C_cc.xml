      <p begin="00:00:00.25" dur="00:00:10.75">RAY: Your answers suggest you feel pretty committed to a plan, or maybe you believe in your ability to implement the plan if you chose to, but you're still sorting through what's most important to you.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:11.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: Sometimes this happens when you have conflicting values â€“ two things that balance each other out.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:17.00" dur="00:00:06.00">RAY: Perhaps returning to the Values activity might clarify things and help you in deciding which way to move.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:23.00" dur="00:00:05.00">RAY: Some people find that talking things through with someone they trust can help.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:28.00" dur="00:00:07.00">RAY: Others are thinkers and they just need to sit down and really consider what these values mean to them, and how they fit into their life.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:35.00" dur="00:00:12.00">RAY: You're in the best position to decide which approach may work best for you. In any case, it seems that focusing on the values side of the equation may help you figure out the next step.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:47.00" dur="00:00:05.00">RAY: You also may want to consider if you're ready to set a date to begin.</p>
