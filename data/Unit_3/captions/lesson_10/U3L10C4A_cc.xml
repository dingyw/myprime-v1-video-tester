	   Your answers suggest your values are important to you and you’re thinking seriously about making this plan happen.  Think about it this way—when steaks on the grill are ready, you don’t cook them longer, you act, by taking them off the grill and eating.  It sounds like your plan is ready, and it’s time to act—to take the next step and start your plan.  Now, it’s time to consider if you’re ready to set a date to begin.
