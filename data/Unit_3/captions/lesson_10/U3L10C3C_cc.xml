      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Now think about your past experiences, everything you've learned in this program about choices, and the future you want for yourself.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: If you want to, you can review some of the responses you've provided in the other exercises by going to the mystuff page.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Here's another scale that goes from 1 to 10. This scale represents how committed you are to implementing your plan.</p> 
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: How committed you are to implementing your plan? Move the slider to pick a number. One is not at all committed; 10 is completely committed.</p>
      <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Again, you may be at a 10 for being committed to your plan, or you might be 6, or another number.</p> 
	  <p begin="00:00:00.00" dur="00:00:01.00">NARRATOR: Whatever your level of commitment is to your plan, enter that number. And by the way, it's okay if this number is different from the last one.</p>
